## Journey Builder


The Journey Builder works on a conversation & edit basis where based on the 


(a) conversation with the user, 


(b) data entry like file uploads and integrations, and 


(c) manual edits, 


Journeys are created.


Journeys consist of:


1. Sections
2. Subsections (could be multi-level)
3. Modules


Modules are building blocks of the journeys which accumulate into Sections and Subsections.


There are different types of Modules, such as:


1. Text-based Description / Introduction ( where employees should understand the info within a document or descriptive text)
2. Checklist (where employees make sure that they have done a series of tasks that are not defined or could not be defined using other modules. Checklists are more like the "Other" option when neither of the other modules are applicable)
3. Meet People (where employees meet with some people so that they get to know the team and get some knowledge)
4. Calendar Event (Events other than meeting with people like intro to company seminars or entry-level people meetups)
5. Familiarize with People (Familiarizing with people in the company and team with some descriptions about them)
6. Familiarize with Tools (getting to know the tools that employees need to work with)
7. Familiarize with Resources (getting to know the resources and files needed to do the work)
8. Review & Reflection (Review, which is a summary of multiple modules or sections or subsections passed before. Like a review of the “Understand our services” section) 
9. Case Study & Scenarios 
10. Multiple Choice Questions 
11. Written Answer Questions (Asking the employee some questions and wanting her to write down answers)
12. Polls
13. Casual Networking Meet 
15. Multimedia (Video, Images, Audio)
16. Administrative & account setups


The journey creation steps in Journey Builder:
1) journey creatio start with filling out the description of the role and the company, as well as the purpose of the journey (like new hire onboarding or project onboarding or new policy communication) and its audience (like sales team, dev team, all employees). 


Then, based on the info above:


2) Our AI system searches different Journey Templates and finds the proper template for the required journey. Then, it tries to populate the Journey Template with as much relevant info as is provided in step 1. Also, our AI system identifies what type of information is missing in each module that requires further user input.

3) Then, the semi-populated Journey is shown to the user, and the user is asked to provide additional info for each module and then fully populate the module with relevant info. 


4) Once every module is fully populated, the journey is ready.

Point: a journey template consists of Sections (Contains: a descriptive title of section + # of subsections), Subsection (Contains: a descriptive title of subsection + # of modules), modules (Contains: Module Type + a descriptive title of module).  


## Virtual Buddy


The **Virtual Buddy** is the guide and AI-chatbot interface through which employees go through the Journeys created by **Journey Builder**. Virtual Buddy also answers all questions the employees might have about the Journey they are going through by accessing the files and integrations from Journey Creation phase.
