Testimonials
Trusted by world-class teams
For better or worse I spend many hours each day in meetings. I've tried multiple transcribers and Circleback blows everyone out of the water ð¤¯ Amazing, well-organized, actionable notes emailed to everyone after the meeting!! ð
Pavla Bobosikova
CEO, WFHomie
After I got my first AI notetaker, I was still so paranoid about robots failing in the most crucial moments, that I spent weeks still handwriting notes + using the tool at the same time.  Now, I don't think I could function without Circleback because of its insanely elaborate action item/task creation.
Sara Loretta
Founder and Chief Digital Architect, _systms
By far the best AI note-taker out there. We use it to automate our CRM update process.
Karun Kaushik
Founder and CEO, Delve
I have used Circleback as part of my founding tech stack and it has been hugely impactful to the growth to Tech Savvy Assistant. Automated transcriptions allow me to be present in my meetings with clients and business leaders, identifying the important action items I would otherwise miss.
Jessica McBride
Founder, Tech Savvy Assistant
Circleback has been a game-changer for my sales team. It has allowed us to focus on what we do best - selling - and not get bogged down with administrative tasks. It's so easy to use and has helped us save time, stay organized, and keep track of our clients and their needs.
Josh Hezghia
Global VP of Sales, Blueground
I've been a happy client for four months. It's my very own note-taking shadow. Every time I have a call, Circleback's AI quietly joins the call, transcribes the entire chat, compiles meeting minutes, and emails them to all attendees. It's meeting minute magic.
Chris Tran
Executive Coach
Iâve been using Circleback over the last few months and Iâm amazed by the quality of the meeting summaries. It's an incredible tool.
Gustaf Alstromer
Group Partner, Y Combinator
Circleback is the best AI meeting notetaker I've used. I've tried a few others including AI notetakers from Zoom and Outreach, and Circleback is the only one that generates actually useful summaries and insights. Highly recommended and excited to see how the product evolves.
Avthar Sewrathan
Lead Technical Product Marketing Manager, Timescale
Genuinely, Circleback is one of my favorite products. Love it so muchânot sure how I did meetings without it. I feel 10x more productive with it. Seriously, it's awesome!
Aaron Wang
Founder, Apriora
Honestly one of the most delightful experiences I've had with an AI app.
Chris Paul
Founder,

I've tried a handful of other similar apps and this is the best one. So cool. I'm in love.

Our teamâs been using Circleback and itâs been great. The action items are especially useful, itâs helped our team planning a ton.
Karine Mellata
Founder, Intrinsic
I think I've tried all of the note taking tools, and somehow Circleback is by far the best of all of them. Love the webhook feature too.
Matthew McClure
Founder and VP of Developer Experience, Mux
Iâve tried 7+ AI note takers and my favorite one by far is Circleback.
Hamel Husain
AI Engineer, Parlance Labs
Circlebackâs note-taking capabilities are nothing short of extraordinary. It effortlessly captures essential information during client meetings, allowing us to record key points and action items with ease. With Circleback, weâve been able to increase our client capacity while also improving the accuracy and organization of our records.
Summer Timmer
Client Success Coach, Dental Implant Machine
I've been using Circleback for the last month. It does a great job with summarizing the meeting (higher quality than other tools I've used in the past), especially at creating a list of action items that come out of a meeting which can be auto-added to Linear which is really nice.
Jon OâBryan
Founder and CEO, Atlas
In an effort to increase and streamline my team's communication, Circleback has been a huge help. No longer do I need to create summary emails and action items after team calls.

What's new in Circleback. Learn about the latest product features and improvements.
August 22, 2024
Select microphone used for recordings
When recording a meeting on Circleback, you can now open the microphone dropdown to select which microphone is used for the recording. The system default is pre-selected and once the recording has started, the selected device cannot be changed.
August 15, 2024
Associate recorded meetings with calendar events
You can now associate meetings that you record on Circleback with events on your calendar. When you go to record a new meeting, a calendar event that's starting soon will be automatically selected. You can choose a different event from the dropdown and begin recording when ready.
The recorded meeting will be associated with metadata from the selected calendar event, including the event name and invitees.
August 7, 2024
Increased import limit
We've increased the limit for importing meetings from 500 MB/130 minutes to a simple limit of 2 GB. Going forward, you can import audio or video files of any length as long as the file is 2 GB or smaller. For files beyond this size, we recommend converting video files to audio-only or compressing the file to reduce its size.
August 6, 2024
monday.com integration
Circleback is now available on the
monday.com marketplace
and integrates with monday.com to automatically create items for each action item from your meetings.
To get started, add a step to a new or existing workflow and choose the monday.com board and group where you want items created. When the workflow runs for a meeting, it will automatically create an item for each action item and assign it to the relevant person.
August 2, 2024
Better search
We've made improvements to searching your meetings. You can now search for a specific meeting name, for something someone said, or ask a question like "When did Sandy say the meeting on Friday was?" from anywhere in Circleback.
Press
/
on your keyboard or click into the search bar that is now always at the top of Circleback to try it out.
August 2, 2024
Recent meetings in details panel
Starting today, you'll see recent meetings with the same invitees in the meeting details panel. This lets you see a timeline of recent meetings you've had with the same group of people and quickly review previous conversations before jumping into your next meeting with them.
August 1, 2024
Streamed recordings
We've made recording meetings with Circleback more robust. Recordings are now incrementally streamed to the cloud. This means that your recording will be saved and accessible in Circleback even if something happens to your browser or device (e.g. a crash occurs or runs out of battery).
August 1, 2024
Workflow context menu
Building on the recent release for meetings, you can now right-click a workflow on the workflows page to quickly share or delete it.
July 30, 2024
Meeting context menu
You can now right-click a meeting on the meetings page to quickly share it, run a workflow, or delete it. The meeting context menu is available even while a meeting is in progress or processing, allowing you to share a meeting without waiting for it to finish.
July 28, 2024
Share workflows with your team
Starting today, you can share workflows to simplify automations across your team. To get started, open the dropdown in the top-right corner of a workflow and select Share.
Once you've shared a workflow with a team member, they can enable the shared workflow to automatically run for relevant meetings or run it manually.
Shared workflows will use the workflow creator's connected accounts for integrations, meaning your team can run a shared workflow with no additional setup. Team members will only see insights from shared workflows if they have access to the relevant meeting.
July 17, 2024
Meeting details panel
You can now view information about your past and upcoming meetings in the new meeting details panel.
When hovering over an upcoming meeting in Home, you'll see details about the meeting invitees, including their name, profile picture, email, role, company website, and attendance status.
For past meetings, you'll now see details about each meeting participant alongside an indicator showing their speaking duration.
The meeting assistant can now be found by selecting the Assistant tab of the details panel. The panel can be hidden by clicking the arrow button at the bottom, and opened again by clicking the panel icon at the bottom right of the screen.
July 12, 2024
Add action items to meetings
You can now add action items to your meetings in Circleback in addition to the ones that were automatically identified in the meeting.
Track tasks that weren't automatically identified or discussed during the meeting by selecting "Add action item" on a meeting.
July 10, 2024
Secondary calendars
Starting today, you can connect a secondary Google or Microsoft Outlook calendar to your Circleback account.
You can view and connect calendars from Settings â Calendar.
June 21, 2024
Unified meeting records for teams
We've made it simpler for teams on Circleback to manage their meetings.
Previously, when multiple team members used Circleback for a meeting, separate meeting records were created for each member. This resulted in multiple copies of the same meeting, leading to a lack of a single source of truth.
Starting today, when you attend a meeting with other members of your team, one meeting record is created in Circleback. All team members who enabled Circleback for the meeting automatically get owner access to this single record.
This change ensures all team members see and update the same meeting information, while reducing clutter.
June 19, 2024
Persisting filters
Filters applied to meetings or action items now persist while you're signed in. This means that the filters you apply are saved and continue to apply, instead of being reset, when you return to the meetings or action items tab.
June 18, 2024
Search for team members when sharing a meeting
When sharing a meeting, you can now search to quickly find the team members you want to share the meeting with.
June 18, 2024
Meetings tab update: your own and shared meetings in one place
All of your meetings are now accessible in the Meetings tab. If you're on a team plan, you can toggle between all meetings accessible to you, your own meetings, or those shared with you by using the new filter in the Meetings tab.
June 16, 2024
One Circleback bot participant per meeting
Starting today, for meetings with multiple invitees using Circleback, only one Circleback bot participant will join the call, instead of one bot per user.
A message sent in the meeting chat will indicate the names of all users who are using Circleback for that specific meeting. Each user will still see the meeting in their account as before.
June 12, 2024
Improved insights table
We've improved how insights are displayed and can be accessed on Circleback.
The layout now makes better use of the screen space available, allowing more insights to be viewed at once
Insights with multiple custom fields can be horizontally scrolled, providing access to all details
Table cells can be expanded with a click to view full contents
The insights table content can be downloaded as a CSV
June 12, 2024
Support for Zoom webinars
You can now use Circleback in Zoom meetings and webinars that require registration. As with any other meeting, Circleback can automatically join via your calendar or a meeting link that includes a
tk
query parameter.
June 11, 2024
Participant speaking durations
You can now see how much time each participant spent speaking during a meeting by opening the participants panel. Hover over a participant to see their speaking time as a percentage of the whole meeting.
May 29, 2024
Send to Slack in threads
If you've set up a workflow in Circleback to send notes to a Slack channel, they'll now show up there formatted as a thread. This makes it easier to keep track of your meetings in Slack.
May 29, 2024
Transcript tab updates
We've released several improvements to the transcript tab to make your meeting playback experience better.
Real-time word highlighting for easy follow-along
Automatic scrolling
New "Scroll to now" button to quickly return to your current position in the transcript
Click on any word to jump to that moment in the video
Video player moved to the right for better visibility while scrolling through the transcript
Significant performance improvements
You can now also share a link to a specific moment in your meeting by selecting the moment you'd like to share, and selecting Share moment from the popup menu.
May 24, 2024
Run workflows manually
You can now manually run workflows for a meeting. To do this, go to a meeting, open the â¦ menu in the top right corner, and select Workflows.
This will show you the workflows relevant to the meeting. From here, you can run a workflow and check the status of previously-run workflows.
Disabled workflows also appear here in case you'd prefer to run certain workflows manually instead.
May 23, 2024
Support for adding notes to companies on Attio
When integrating with Attio in a workflow, you can now choose to have notes automatically added to companies after meetings. This is in addition to the existing support for adding notes to people on Attio.
Circleback will look up the people who were invited to the calendar event and add a new note to their associated company in Attio.
As before, you can choose to include meeting notes, action items, or other insights in the new note that's added.
May 17, 2024
Referral link and track your free months
Telling someone about Circleback? You can now share your referral link to get a free month for each referral. Go to Settings â Billing to copy your referral link and see how many free months you've earned from referrals.
May 17, 2024
Notion database integration
You can now use workflows in Circleback to automatically update Notion databases and tables.
To get started, select Update Notion in an existing or new workflow and choose a database you'd like to update. Once you've selected a database, you can choose an outcome to update each database property (column in the table) with.
For each property, you can choose outcomes related to the meeting, action items, or insights. If you have insights defined in the same workflow, you can map the insight or specific fields from the insight to a database property.
When there are multiple action items or insights associated with a meeting, a new row will be inserted for each.
May 3, 2024
Improved meeting sharing
We've added more control over how you can share your meetings, including the ability to manually email meeting notes to people you met with. Clicking Share in the top right of your meetings will bring up a new modal with two tabs: Access and Email.
The Access tab is where you can create a publicly shareable meeting link or share the meeting with your team.
You can manually send out meeting notes from the Email tab, even if you've disabled automatic invitee emails in Settings â Emails. This gives you a chance to make any changes to the notes and action items before they're sent out and have more control over who receives the notes.
May 1, 2024
Automatic joining preference for meetings hosted by you
You can now choose to have Circleback only join meetings you create on your calendar. Head over to Settings â Calendar to find the new toggle.
With it enabled, Circleback will, by default, only automatically join meetings created by you and not those you were invited to. You can always override the automatic joining behaviour for individual upcoming meetings from Home.
April 24, 2024
Get free Circleback with referrals
Starting today, you earn a free month for each person who joins through the meeting notes emails sent to attendees. It's our way of saying thanks for spreading the word about Circleback.
To take advantage of this, just make sure attendee emails are enabled by going to Settings â Emails. Your referral credits will appear in the billing portal once the referred person starts their Circleback subscription.
April 17, 2024
Webhook signature verification
To ensure the the webhook events received are from Circleback, you can now choose to verify incoming requests using a signing secret. This is an optional step, but it is recommended for added security.
Go to Settings â Webhook to manage your signing secret and learn more about how to verify incoming requests.
April 17, 2024
HubSpot and Salesforce integration improvements
You can now choose to add notes directly to deals in HubSpot or opportunities in Salesforce. If you'd rather have your contacts updated, you can do that too.
To try this out, create a
new workflow
and choose update HubSpot or Salesforce.
April 10, 2024
Improved mobile web experience
The new mobile web experience allows you to access all the features of Circleback directly from your phone. To get started, log in to Circleback by navigating to app.circleback.ai from your phone. Once logged in, you can view meetings, action items, workflows, insights, and settings by opening the navigation drawer from the top-left corner.
To add Circleback to your iPhone's home screen, open the share sheet in Safari and select "Add to Home Screen".
April 9, 2024
Team admin and billing owner controls
You can now grant admin privileges or transfer billing ownership to other team members from Settings â Team. Please note that only the billing owner can transfer billing ownership and manage billing for the team.
April 5, 2024
Number of insights per meeting
You can now choose the number of instances of an insight you want identified per meeting. By default, Circleback automatically chooses this based on the meeting context and the insight description. However, for certain insights, such as "How did this customer learn about our product?", you may opt to limit the identification to only one of the insight per meeting.
This configuration is available when defining an insight in a workflow.
April 1, 2024
Language setting
You can now choose the language your notes will be in. By default, the main language spoken in the meeting will be the language that your notes will be written in. If you choose any of the 133 languages we support, no matter the language spoken in the meeting your notes will be in the language you've selected.
To try this out, go to Settings â Account and choose a language.
April 1, 2024
Copy improvements
You can now easily comment on or copy a highlighted piece of your transcript. Use the keyboard shortcuts to make this happen even faster.
March 28, 2024
Zoho CRM integration
Circleback now integrates with Zoho to automatically update your CRM with notes, action items, and other insights from your meetings.
Once you've set up a workflow with Zoho, Circleback will look up who you met with (using the emails invited to the calendar event) after meetings. For each contact found in Zoho, a note will be automatically added with the selected meeting outcomes.
March 26, 2024
Attio integration
Circleback now integrates with Attio to automatically update your CRM with notes, action items, and other insights from your meetings.
Once you've set up a workflow with Attio, Circleback will look up the people you met with (using the emails invited to the calendar event) after meetings. For each person found in Attio, a note will be automatically added with the selected meeting outcomes.
March 13, 2024
Comments on transcript
You can now highlight moments and leave comments for your team for each of your meetings. Collaborate in comment threads on any meeting that has been shared with you, and get notified of new comments by email.
March 12, 2024
Custom fields for insights
You can now customize the exact structure for the insights you set up in workflows.
For example, let's say you'd like to track all feature requests that come up in your customer interview meetings, as well as the "why" motivating each request. You can create two custom text fields, Feature request and Why, on the insight and each will be populated for any new feature requests identified in your meetings.
As before, you can view these insights in aggregate or for an individual meeting from the Insights tab.
February 26, 2024
Shareable moments
You can now share a specific moment in your meetings by copying a link to it. To try this out, go to the Transcript tab on any of your meetings and select
Copy link to moment
when hovering over the part of the transcript you'd like to share. The link will open to the specific moment in the transcript and meeting recording (if available).
If you previously created a shareable link for the meeting, anyone with the link can view the moment. Otherwise, the link will only be accessible by those on your team that you've shared the meeting with.
February 25, 2024
Insights tab
We've added an Insights tab, where you can see all of the insights from across your meetings in one place.
As an example, let's say you've created a workflow with an insight defined in it called
Client questions
that will pull out all of the client questions that come up in a meeting. You'll now be able to see all of the client questions that were generated by your workflow from the Insights tab.
February 16, 2024
Download meeting recording and increased retention
We've introduced the ability to download video or audio of meetings with saved recordings by clicking the button in the top-right corner of the player in the meeting transcript tab. We've also increased the retention of recordings from 30 days to 365 days!
As a reminder, you can enable saving recordings by going to Settings â Account.
February 15, 2024
Workflows
Your meetings have a lot of useful information in them (a goldmine, if you will). We've built workflows to help you find and automatically action on the parts most important to you.
Workflows on Circleback combine two powerful capabilities:
Insights
There are certain things you care about across different types of meetings you're in. If you're talking to potential a customer for the first time, you might want to gather context on how their business works. What industry are they in? How many people work at the company? Workflows allow you to easily capture this information.
Insights generated will show up in a new tab for each meeting. We'll soon be releasing the ability to view insights across different meetings in one place.
Integrations
We've introduced integrations with a handful of platformsâSlack, Notion, Linear, HubSpot, and Salesforceâwhich you can quickly configure through workflows.
Insights and integrations, combined in a workflow, can automate a wide range of tasks. Some examples include:
Send action items to the relevant team's Slack channel
Create a page in Notion with the meeting notes and customer industry
Create Linear issues for action items and feature requests that came up during a demo call
Update HubSpot with the meeting notes and customer industry
Workflows can run after every meeting or ones with selected tags and participants. The applicable workflows will run when a tag is either manually or
automatically applied
to a meeting.
This is just the beginningâwe're working on improving how insights are generated and surfaced, smartening up our existing integrations, and adding support for new integrations. We're excited to work with you to make workflows a powerful tool for getting things done.
February 14, 2024
Slack huddles support
Circleback now supports Slack huddles! Connect your Slack workspace from Settings â Team to get notes, action items, a transcript, and a recording (if enabled) for Slack huddles. Circleback can automatically join huddles in public channels. To get notes for huddles in a private channel, a participant can add Circleback to the huddle.
Slack huddles support is still in betaâlet us know your thoughts via live chat (another release that probably deserves its own post) or email.
February 9, 2024
Review last meeting
Ever joined a meeting without a clue about where things were left last time? Today, we added a simple but powerful button to your upcoming meetings to help with that.
If you've had a previous meeting with the same attendees, you'll see an icon in the top right that'll let you quickly review the last meeting on Circleback. Check up on the action items, read over the notes, and go into that next meeting prepared.
January 23, 2024
Automatically tag meetings
You can now have your meetings automatically tagged. This means the most relevant of your existing tags will be applied to your meetings automatically. You can enable this option in Settings â Account. To add a tag to an existing meeting, open a meeting and select Add tag at the top.
January 5, 2024
Mobile-optimized meeting page
With the introduction of shareable meeting links, we wanted to make sure that the links you share look good regardless of where they're opened. To that end, we've made improvements to make sure meetings work well on mobile.
When opening a meeting on your phone, you'll now be able to see the meeting details, notes, transcript, and watch the recording (if available).

Shareable meeting links
Starting today, users on a team plan can create and share a link that provides those outside the team access to view the meeting on Circleback. To get started, select Share on a meeting and select Create and copy link.
Anyone with the link can view the meeting notes, transcript, and recording (if available) even if they don't have a Circleback account. Those with the link can also use the meeting assistant and search but cannot make any edits or updates. You can revoke access via the shareable link by selecting Remove link access from the same modal.
As part of this release, we also enabled sharing functions for shared meetings that are not your own. This means you can share a meeting you have access to with additional teammates or via a shareable link.
December 24, 2023
Improved meeting assistant and search
We've made changes that improve the quality of responses when using the meeting assistant and search. Additionally, the meeting date is now included alongside its name in the search results. As before, combine search with filters to find something in a subset of your meetings. Happy holidays!
December 19, 2023
Custom vocabulary
Starting today, you can define your custom vocabulary to improve the accuracy of transcribing specific words, names, phrases, or technical terms. You can update your vocabulary by going to Settings â Account.
December 15, 2023
Participant colours in the transcript
We've made it easier to read through and navigate a transcript by using a unique colour for each participant. Open the transcript of a meeting to check it out.
December 14, 2023
Save and replay meeting recordings
Starting today, you can save and replay audio and video recordings from your meetings. To enable this, switch on the toggle from Settings â Account. Once enabled, meeting recordings will be available in the transcript tab where you can click on different parts of the transcript to jump around in the recording.
Recordings are automatically deleted after 30 days. With recordings enabled, you'll also get a link to download the recording on the meeting webhook event.
December 5, 2023
Copy notes and transcript
No more drag clicking down multiple pages to copy notes. We added a button to copy the notes or transcript of a meeting. Open a meeting on Circleback and look for the copy button in the top right.
November 30, 2023
Invite team members to Circleback
Beginning today, you can add members from your team to Circleback without them needing to have a Circleback account first. Add a member as usual from Settings â Team. If they've yet to create a Circleback account, they'll get an email letting them know you added them to the team. Once they login, they'll become a member of the team.
November 30, 2023
Action items tab
Starting today, you can view and manage action items for yourself, your team, and people you've met with from one place. Filter, edit, and check off tasks with a little celebration. Not sure about something? Select the linked meeting to get more context. Select Action Items on the left to get started.
November 21, 2023
Faster login emails
We've made improvements that result in login emails arriving in your inbox much faster than before. It's up to you to figure out what to do with that extra minute.
November 14, 2023
Record conversations
Following the release of our import feature, today's we're releasing the ability to record conversations directly from Circleback on desktop and mobile. Once a recording is uploaded, you'll get notes, action items, and a transcript in the app. Open Circleback and select Record in the top right to get started.
October 23, 2023
Import meetings by uploading audio and video files
We've heard you loud and clear. Today, we're releasing the ability to import recorded conversations to Circleback by uploading an audio or video file.
Once imported, you'll get notes, action items, and a diarized transcript just the same. Select a participant to enter their name and your changes will be reflected throughout the meeting. Use Circleback for any conversation, whether it's in-person or virtual. Select Import in the top right on your phone or desktop to get started.
September 19, 2023
Faster navigation
We've shipped performance improvements that make navigating Circleback much snappier. Experience it for yourself!
August 29, 2023
New toggles for calendar and sharing
We're dubbing today Toggle Tuesday because we're releasing two new toggles.
Accepted meetings
Once enabled, this new toggle makes it so that Circleback only joins meetings on your calendar that you've accepted. This works as an additional filter on top of the previous toggles. For example, if you've set Circleback to join internal meetings, toggling this on will make it so that Circleback only joins internal meetings that you've accepted. You can configure this from Settings â Calendar.
Automatic sharing
This new toggle for teams enables you to automatically share meetings your team. You can still unshare an automatically-shared meeting.
August 15, 2023
Webhook integration
Our webhook integration is here! Send your meeting data to Slack, Notion, Airtable, HubSpot, Salesforce, or wherever else you'd like either directly or via services like Zapier and Make.com. Go to Settings â Webhook to learn more and get started.
July 24, 2023
Action items
We're making it easier to manage action items from meetings, starting by automatically creating assigned action items. After every meeting, Circleback will automatically create action items for tasks that came up in conversation. You can update the title, description, and assignee of action items. All done? Go ahead and check them off.
June 12, 2023
Tagging, email notifications, and design improvements
We shipped a few things this week.
Tagging
We introduced the ability to tag meetings to ease discovery. Go to a meeting and select Add tag to get started. Meetings can also be filtered by tags.
Email notifications
Have meeting notes and action items be automatically sent to yourself and other meeting attendees. You can toggle these settings from Settings â Emails. Only attendees invited to the calendar event will receive the post-meeting email.
Design improvements
We've made Circleback more beautiful and easy to use but you'll still recognize it.
June 2, 2023
Share meetings with individual team members
Have a meeting that you don't want to share with the whole team? Now you can share it with individual team members. Go to a meeting and press Share to get started.
May 8, 2023
Upcoming meetings and filtering
Following up on the ability to connect your calendar, this week we released the ability to see the upcoming meetings on your calendar when you log on to Circleback.
We also released filtering to make it easier to comb through your meeting.
April 27, 2023
Connect your calendar
Starting today, you can connect your Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook Calendar and have Circleback automatically join the meetings you choose. Circleback will automatically detect meeting links in your calendar events and join or request to join the meeting when it starts. Go to Settings â Calendar to get started.
April 3, 2023
Meeting assistant
Today, we're releasing the meeting assistant. The meeting assistant can ask questions using the context of your meeting like "what are the next steps?" as well as perform writing tasks like writing a follow-up email. Open Circleback and hop into a conversation with your meeting.

Increased import limit
August 7, 2024
We've increased the limit for importing meetings from 500 MB/130 minutes to a simple limit of 2 GB. Going forward, you can import audio or video files of any length as long as the file is 2 GB or smaller. For files beyond this size, we recommend converting video files to audio-only or compressing the file to reduce its size.

Custom fields for insights
March 12, 2024
You can now customize the exact structure for the insights you set up in workflows.
For example, let's say you'd like to track all feature requests that come up in your customer interview meetings, as well as the "why" motivating each request. You can create two custom text fields, Feature request and Why, on the insight and each will be populated for any new feature requests identified in your meetings.
As before, you can view these insights in aggregate or for an individual meeting from the Insights tab.

Improved meeting sharing
May 3, 2024
We've added more control over how you can share your meetings, including the ability to manually email meeting notes to people you met with. Clicking Share in the top right of your meetings will bring up a new modal with two tabs: Access and Email.
The Access tab is where you can create a publicly shareable meeting link or share the meeting with your team.
You can manually send out meeting notes from the Email tab, even if you've disabled automatic invitee emails in Settings â Emails. This gives you a chance to make any changes to the notes and action items before they're sent out and have more control over who receives the notes.

You can now choose the number of instances of an insight you want identified per meeting. By default, Circleback automatically chooses this based on the meeting context and the insight description. However, for certain insights, such as "How did this customer learn about our product?", you may opt to limit the identification to only one of the insight per meeting.
This configuration is available when defining an insight in a workflow.

THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEME
NT DOES SO ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY (âCustomerâ); SUCH INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF THE INDIVIDUAL ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT DOES NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR THE APPLICABLE ENTITY DOES NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, SUCH INDIVIDUAL MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE OR RECEIVE THE SERVICE. CAPITALIZED TERMS HAVE THE DEFINITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
1. The Service
1.1. Service Description. Circleback is the owner and provider of a cloud-based software for meeting automations (the âServiceâ). Anything Customer (including Users) posts, uploads, shares, stores, or otherwise provides through the Service is considered a âUser Submission.â Customer is solely responsible for all User Submissions it contributes to the Service. Further terms regarding User Submissions, including ownership, are in Section 8.2 below. The Service may also include templates, help documents, and other documents or information that can assist Customer using the Service (âCircleback Contentâ). Customer will not receive or have access to the code or software that underlies the Service (collectively the âSoftwareâ) or receive a copy of the Software itself.
1.2. Customerâs Subscription. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer may purchase a subscription to, and has the right to access and use, the Service as specified in one or more ordering screens agreed to by the parties through Circlebackâs website that reference this Agreement and describe the business terms related to Customerâs subscription (âOrder(s)â). All subscriptions will be for the period described on the applicable Order (âSubscription Periodâ). Use of and access to the Service is permitted only by individuals authorized by Customer and for Customerâs own internal business purposes and not for the benefit of any third party (âUsersâ).
1.3. Circlebackâs Ownership. Circleback owns the Service, Software, Circleback Content, Documentation, and anything else provided by Circleback to Customer (collectively the âCircleback Materialsâ). Circleback retains all right, title and interest (including, without limitation, all patent, copyright, trademarks, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Circleback Materials, all related and underlying technology and any updates, enhancements, upgrades, modifications, patches, workarounds, and fixes thereto and all derivative works of or modifications to any of the foregoing. There are no implied licenses under this Agreement and any rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement are expressly reserved by Circleback.
1.4. Permissions. The Service contains customizable settings allowing each User to give permission to other Users to perform various tasks within the Service (âPermissionsâ). It is also solely Customerâs responsibility to set and manage all Permissions, including which Users can set such Permissions. Accordingly, Circleback will have no responsibility for managing Permissions and no liability for the Permissions set by Customer and its Users. Customer may, at its option, provide access to the Service and Documentation to its Affiliates (defined below), in which case all rights granted, and obligations incurred, under this Agreement will also inure to the benefit of such Affiliates. Customer represents and warrants that it is fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Affiliates and that Customer has the power to negotiate this Agreement on behalf of its Affiliates. Customer will also be responsible for all payment obligations under this Agreement regardless of whether the use of the Service is by Customer or its Affiliates. Any claim by an Affiliate against Circleback will be brought by Customer and not the Affiliate. For the purposes of this Agreement âAffiliateâ will mean of a party will mean an entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with that party (where âcontrolâ means the ownership or control, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of all the voting power of the shares (or other securities or rights) entitled to vote for the election of directors or other governing authority.
2. Restrictions
2.1. Customerâs Responsibilities. Customer is responsible for all activity on its Usersâ accounts unless such activity is caused by a third party bad actor able to access Customerâs account by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Service itself. Customer will ensure that its Users are aware of and bound by obligations and/or restrictions stated in this Agreement and Customer will be responsible for breach of any such obligation and/or restriction by a User.
2.2. Use Restrictions. Customer agrees that it will not, and will not allow Users or third parties to, directly or indirectly (a) modify, translate, copy or create derivative works based on the Service, (b) reverse assemble, reverse compile, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the object code, source code, non-public APIs or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Service, except as and only to the extent this restriction is prohibited by law, (c) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any third party, other than Authorized Customers, (d) remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices, legends or Circleback branding contained in or on the Service, (e) use the Service in any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local or international law or regulation, (f) attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage or disrupt any parts of the Service, including, without limitation, by introducing viruses and other harmful code or by using flood pings, denial-of-service attacks, or similar methods or technology, (g) use or access the Service to build or support and/or assist a third party in building or supporting products or services competitive to the Service or (h) attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of the Service or any Circleback system or networks. If Customer (including Users) is using the Service in a manner that, in Circlebackâs reasonable judgment, causes or is likely to cause significant harm to Circleback or the Service or otherwise threatens the security, integrity or availability of the Service then Circleback may suspend Customerâs access to the Service. Circleback will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances of such suspension to (x) provide Customer with notice and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any such suspension; (y) limit the suspension to only accounts involved in the activities in question; and (z) remove the suspension as quickly as practicable after the circumstances leading to the suspension have been resolved.
2.3. API Access Restrictions. As part of provision of its Service, Circleback may provide Customer with access to one or more application program interfaces (âAPI(s)â). Circleback may, in its sole discretion, set and enforce limits on Customerâs use of the API and Customer agrees to adhere to such limits. Circleback may also suspend Customerâs access to the API or cease providing the API at any time.
3. Third-Party Applications
â¯The Service may work together with third party products, services or applications that are not owned or controlled by Circleback, (e.g., Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook Calendar) (âThird-Party Applicationsâ) and Customer, at its sole option, may choose to use such Third-Party Applications. If necessary for the Service and the Third-Party Application to work together, Customer will provide its login information to Circleback for the sole purpose of Circleback providing the Service to Customer and Customer represents and warrants that Customer has the right to provide such login information without breach by Customer of any of the terms and conditions that govern Customerâs use of the applicable Third-Party Application. Circleback does not endorse such Third-Party Applications. Customer acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not apply to Customerâs use of such Third-Party Applications and Customer be required by the providers of such Third-Party Applications to enter into separate agreements for Customerâs use. Circleback expressly disclaims all representations and warranties relating to any Third-Party Applications. Customer will look solely to the providers of the Third-Party Applications for any warranty related issues or other claims. Customerâs use of Third-Party Applications is at Customerâs own risk. Circleback will have no liability or other obligation of any kind arising out of or related to any third-party applications, including arising from Customerâs use or inability to use Third-Party Applications.
4. Payment Obligations
4.1. Fees. Customer will pay for access to and use of the Service as set forth on the applicable Order (âFeesâ). All Fees will be paid in the currency stated in the applicable Order or, if no currency is specified, U.S. dollars. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in this Agreement, non-refundable. Circleback may modify its Fees or introduce new fees in its sole discretion. Customer always has the right to choose not to renew its subscription if it does not agree with any new or revised Fees.
4.2. Payment. Circleback, either directly or through its third-party payment processor (âPayment Processorâ) will charge Customer for the Fees via credit card or ACH payment, pursuant to the credit card or ACH payment information provided by Customer to Circleback. Circleback will have the right to charge Customerâs credit card or ACH payment method for any services provided to Customer by Circleback â¯under the Order, including recurring Fees. It is Customerâs sole responsibility to provide Circleback with current and up-to-date credit card or ACH information; failure to provide such information may result in suspension of Customerâs access to the Services. Circleback will also have the right to set-off any Fees due from Customer to Circleback. If Customer pays the Fees through a Payment Processor such payment processing will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. Circleback is not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. Circleback reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if Circleback has already requested or received payment. If authorized by Customer through acceptance of an Order, recurring charges (e.g. monthly billing) will be charged to Customerâs payment instrument without further authorization from Customer, until Customer terminates this Agreement in accordance with its terms or changes its payment method in Customerâs account in the Service.
4.3. Taxes. Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, âTaxesâ). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If Circleback has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, Circleback will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides Circleback with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority in advance. For clarity, Circleback is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property, and employees.
4.4. Failure to Pay. If Customer fails to pay any Fees when due, Circleback may suspend Customerâs access to the Service pending payment of such overdue amounts. Customer also authorizes Circleback to make multiple re-attempts at charging the Customerâs payment instrument if an initial charge attempt is unsuccessful, without any specific limit on the number of retries. If Customer believes that Circleback has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact Circleback no later than sixty (60)â¯days after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, to receive an adjustment or credit. Once Circleback receives notice of a disputed invoice, Circleback will review such notice and provide Customer with a written decision regarding the dispute, including documentary support for such decision. If Circleback reasonably determines that the amounts billed are, in fact, due, Customer will pay such amounts (if it has not done so already) within ten (10) days of Circleback notifying Customer in writing of such decision.
5. Term and Termination
5.1. Agreement Term and Renewals. Subscriptions to access and use the Service commence on the start date stated on the applicable Order (âSubscription Start Dateâ) and continue for the duration of the Subscription Period. Customer may choose not to renew its Subscription Period by notifying Circleback at support@circleback.ai (provided that Circleback confirms such cancellation in writing) or by modifying its subscription through Customerâs account within the Service. This Agreement will become effective on the first day of the Subscription Period and remain effective for the duration of the Subscription Period stated on the Order along with any renewals of the Subscription Period and any period that Customer is using the Service even if such use is not under a paid Order (âTermâ). If the parties terminate this Agreement, it will automatically terminate all Orders. If Customer cancels or does not renew its paid subscription to the Service, Customerâs subscription will be accessible but will automatically be downgraded to a version of the Service with diminished features and limited functionality to view existing data that Circleback offers to unpaid subscribers (âFree Versionâ). If Customer or Circleback terminates this Agreement or Customer deletes its account within the Service, Customer will not have access to the Free Version.
5.2. Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the breaching partyâs receipt of such notice. Circleback may terminate Customerâs access to the Free Version at any time without notice to Customer.
5.3. Effect of Termination. If Customer terminates this Agreement because of Circlebackâs uncured breach, Circleback will refund any unused, prepaid Fees for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Period. If Circleback terminates this Agreement because of Customerâs uncured breach, Customer will pay any unpaid Fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Period after the effective date of termination, if any. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees payable to Circleback for the period prior to the effective date of termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, all rights and licenses granted by Circleback hereunder will immediately terminate; Customer will no longer have the right to access or use the Service. Within thirty (30) days of termination of this Agreement for cause, upon Customerâs request following termination, or if Customer deletes its account within the Service, Circleback will delete Customerâs User Information, including all related information, records, and User Submissions, unless Customer requests an earlier deletion in writing. Circleback may delete all User Submissions or User Information if Customer maintains an account in the Free Version but such account is not used for a period of one (1) year or more.
5.4. Survival. Sections titled âCirclebackâs Ownershipâ, âThird-Party Applicationsâ, âPayment Obligationsâ, âTerm and Terminationâ, âWarranty Disclaimerâ, âLimitation of Liabilityâ, âConfidentialityâ, âDataâ and âGeneral Termsâ will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
6. Warranties and Disclaimers
6.1. Warranties. Customer represents and warrants that all User Submissions submitted by Users follow all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
6.2. Warranty Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR HEREIN, THE SERVICES AND ALL RELATED COMPONENTS AND INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED ON AN âAS ISâ AND âAS AVAILABLEâ BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, AND CIRCLEBACK EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT CIRCLEBACK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN TYPES OF WARRANTIES. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
7. Limitation of Liability
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, CIRCLEBACK WILL NOT BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY CAUSE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN AN ACTION BASED ON A CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, HOWEVER ARISING, FOR (A)â¯INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, (B) ANY DAMAGES BASED ON USE OR ACCESS, INTERRUPTION, DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS, DELAYS, INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICES, BUSINESS OR GOODWILL, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, LOSS RESULTING FROM SYSTEM OR SYSTEM SERVICE FAILURE, MALFUNCTION OR SHUTDOWN, FAILURE TO ACCURATELY TRANSFER, READ OR TRANSMIT INFORMATION, FAILURE TO UPDATE OR PROVIDE CORRECT INFORMATION, SYSTEM INCOMPATIBILITY OR PROVISION OF INCORRECT COMPATIBILITY INFORMATION OR BREACHES IN SYSTEM SECURITY, OR (C) ANY DAMAGES THAT IN THE AGGREGATE EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER FOR THE SERVICE THAT IS OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT WHICH GIVES RISE TO SUCH DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

Nothing above will prevent either party from sharing the terms of this Agreement or the name of the other party with prospective investors or acquirors; provided, however, that the foregoing persons or entities are bound to standard confidentiality obligations.
8.3. Compelled Access or Disclosure. The Receiving Party may access or disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if it is required by law; provided, however, that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled access or disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the access or disclosure.
8.3. Compelled Access or Disclosure. The Receiving Party may access or disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only if required by law and after exhausting all reasonable options to avoid disclosure.

10.7. Amendment and Waivers. No modification or amendment to this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed or accepted by an authorized representative of both parties.

Meeting minutes layout: how to design and organize your notes
November 6, 2023
Meetings
Key Elements of a Great Meeting Minutes Layout
Creating an effective meeting minutes layout involves several essential components that help ensure clarity and easy reference for participants. Let's explore these key elements:
Header:
Start with the basic information, such as the meeting's date, time, and location. Include a list of attendees to keep track of who was present during the discussions.
Agenda:
Outline the meeting's purpose and the topics to be discussed. This provides a clear roadmap for the meeting and helps keep the conversation focused.
Body:
Organize the content by sections or topics discussed during the meeting. Provide a brief summary of the discussion, highlighting decisions made and action items assigned. This structure helps readers quickly find and understand the key points.
Conclusion:
Offer a recap of the main points and decisions, as well as any next steps and follow-up actions to be taken. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and understands their responsibilities moving forward.
When designing a meeting minutes simple template, keep these elements in mind to create an organized and easy-to-follow document that effectively captures the essential information.
Tips for Designing and Organizing Meeting Minutes
Creating well-structured and organized meeting minutes is essential for effective communication and reference. Here are some tips to help you design and organize your meeting minutes:
1. Be concise and use bullet points or numbered lists:
Keep your notes clear and easy to read by using bullet points or numbered lists. This will help convey the essential information without overwhelming the reader with too much text.
2. Avoid personal opinions or biases:
Maintain an objective tone in your meeting minutes by focusing on the facts and decisions made during the meeting. Leave out personal opinions or biases to ensure the notes remain accurate and impartial.
3. Use timestamps or time markers for each agenda item:
Including timestamps or time markers for each agenda item can help track the duration of the meeting and make it easier for readers to locate specific discussions in the notes.
4. Distribute meeting minutes to all attendees and stakeholders:
Share the minutes with everyone involved in the meeting to ensure that everyone is on the same page and has access to the necessary information.
5. Use a standardized format or template for consistency:
Adopting a consistent format or template for your meeting minutes will make it easier for readers to understand and follow the content. This consistency also helps create a professional appearance for your notes.
Methods and Tools for Taking Effective Meeting Notes
Utilizing effective note-taking methods and tools can help you capture essential information during meetings and improve productivity. Here are some popular methods and tools for taking meeting notes:
1. Cornell Method:
The Cornell Method involves dividing your note paper into three sections - a narrow left column for keywords, a larger right column for notes, and a bottom section for summarizing the main points. This method encourages active listening and helps you quickly review and recall the key ideas from a meeting.
2. Quadrant Method:
This approach categorizes notes into four quadrants - questions, general notes, action items for yourself, and action items for others. By organizing your notes in this way, you can easily identify and track important tasks and information.
3. Mind Mapping Method:
Mind mapping involves visually organizing information using diagrams, with a central topic branching out into related ideas and subtopics. This method helps you capture and understand the relationships between different concepts discussed during a meeting.
4. Circleback's note-taking capabilities and transcription services:
Circleback offers powerful AI-driven note-taking features that effortlessly capture essential information from client meetings. By providing well-organized and actionable notes, Circleback helps users stay focused on core tasks and improves overall productivity.
5. Integrations with popular meeting platforms:
Circleback seamlessly integrates with popular meeting platforms like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, WebEx, and BlueJeans, ensuring your note-taking process is smooth and efficient no matter which platform you use.
Organizing and Sharing Meeting Notes
Proper organization and sharing of meeting notes are essential for ensuring that all team members can access and review the information discussed during meetings. Here are some tips for organizing and sharing your meeting notes effectively:
1. Using shared locations for easy access:
Store meeting notes in a shared location that is easily accessible to all team members and stakeholders. This can help keep everyone informed and engaged, even if they were unable to attend the meeting.
2. Categorizing notes with #tags or bookmarks:
Organize your notes by using #tags or bookmarks to categorize and highlight important moments in the meeting. This makes it easier for readers to find specific information or action items when reviewing the notes.
3. Utilizing meeting agenda templates:
Create and use meeting agenda templates to organize your notes by headers and include action items, owners, and due dates. This helps maintain consistency and ensures that all relevant information is captured during the meeting.
4. Sharing meeting recaps and summaries:
Distribute meeting recaps and summaries to loop in absentees and provide a concise overview of the main points, next steps, and action items discussed during the meeting.
5. Using AI-powered meeting assistants for organization and follow-up tasks:
Implement AI-powered meeting assistants, like Circleback, to help keep your notes organized and easily accessible. These tools can also assist in managing action items and administrative tasks, giving you more time to focus on core tasks and improving overall productivity.
Transform Your Meeting Notes with Circleback
A well-designed meeting minutes layout is essential for effective communication and improved productivity.

Revolutionize your recorder notes with AI-powered note taking
September 8, 2023
Meetings
Introduction
Traditional note-taking methods often result in incomplete or disorganized recorder notes, which can negatively impact productivity. AI-powered note-taking solutions offer an innovative way to enhance recorder notes, leading to improved organization and increased efficiency. Embracing this technology can transform the way you record and review important information, ultimately benefiting both individuals and businesses.
Understanding AI Note Taker
AI note-taking technology utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to automatically transcribe spoken words into written text, effectively capturing and organizing important information. Compared to traditional note-taking methods, which rely on manual transcription and can be time-consuming and prone to errors, AI note-taking offers a more accurate and efficient approach.
By using an AI-powered note taker, you can benefit from real-time transcription, improved accuracy, and better organization of your recorder notes. This technology not only saves time but also allows you to focus on the discussion at hand, knowing that the AI will accurately record the essential information. Overall, adopting AI note-taking solutions can significantly enhance productivity and streamline your workflow.
Integrating AI Note-Taking into Your Workflow
To make the most of AI-powered note-taking, start by identifying situations where this technology can be particularly beneficial, such as meetings, conferences, interviews, or presentations. In these settings, accurate and timely recorder notes are crucial for effective communication and decision-making.
When using AI note-taking tools, follow best practices like speaking clearly and at a moderate pace to ensure accurate transcription. It's also essential to choose a tool that integrates well with your existing productivity software, allowing for a smooth transition from traditional to AI-driven note-taking.
To ensure a seamless transition, provide training and support to team members adapting to the new technology. Encourage open communication and feedback, addressing any concerns or challenges that may arise. By taking these steps, you can successfully integrate AI note-taking into your workflow and unlock its full potential for increased productivity and organization.
Features to Look for in an AI-Powered Note-Taking Tool
When selecting an AI-powered note-taking tool, consider the following features to ensure you choose the best solution for your needs:
Automatic transcription capabilities are essential for real-time conversion of spoken words into written text. High-quality transcription ensures accurate and comprehensive recorder notes, reducing the need for manual editing.
Integration with existing productivity tools and software, such as project management apps or communication platforms, enhances efficiency and streamlines your workflow, allowing you to easily access and share notes across your organization.
Customization and organization features, like tagging, categorization, and search functionality, enable you to tailor the tool to your specific requirements, making it easier to manage and retrieve information when needed.
Finally, pay attention to security and data privacy considerations. Choose a tool that employs robust encryption measures and adheres to data protection regulations, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your recorded information.

Automatically create Linear issues for tasks that come up in meetings
February 7, 2024
Automation
Important to-dos that need to be tracked and completed come up in conversation all the timeâwhether you're talking to a new customer and they hit a snag in the onboarding flow that needs to be fixed or your team's discussing who's going to create the social media graphics for the new launch.
Circleback automatically detects and assigns these action items. With workflows, you can make sure they end up in the right place on Linear where you manage your team's backlog of tasks. Let's walk through how to set this up.
Login to Circleback
. Don't worry if you don't have an account yet, it takes about 2 minutes to create one.
Go to Workflows from the navigation menu on the left.
Create a workflow.
By default, the workflow will run after every meeting. If you'd like, you can choose to have it run after meetings with certain tags or participants. Choose the relevant filters and continue. You can always update this later.
Select Create issues in Linear.
If you haven't yet, connect the Linear workspace you want to use.
Once you've connected your workspace, select the team where you want the issues to be created in Linear and select Done.
Give your workflow a name at the top and press Create in the top right.
That's it! Next time you use Circleback in a meeting, a Linear issue will be automatically created and assigned to the relevant team member for each action item that comes up. You can set up multiple workflows if you'd like to create issues under separate Linear teams for different types of meetings.

How to choose the right AI-driven meeting notes platform for your business
November 17, 2023
Meetings
Introduction
The importance of efficient note-taking in meetings
Effective note-taking during meetings is crucial for capturing critical information, tracking decisions, and ensuring clear communication among team members. Accurate and well-organized notes enable businesses to make informed decisions and drive productivity.
The rise of AI-driven meeting notes platforms
AI-driven meeting notes platforms have emerged as powerful tools that automate the transcription process, provide actionable insights, and streamline meeting management. These platforms enable businesses to save time, improve communication, and optimize their workflow.
The goal of this blog: helping businesses choose the right platform
As various AI-driven meeting notes platforms offer different features and benefits, selecting the right one for your business can be challenging. This blog aims to assist businesses in identifying the ideal platform to meet their specific needs and enhance their meeting experience.
Key Factors to Consider When Choosing an AI-driven Meeting Notes Platform
Selecting the right AI-driven meeting notes platform for your business can be a daunting task. However, considering these crucial factors will help you make an informed decision and find a platform that meets your specific needs.
Accuracy and Quality of Transcriptions
One of the primary reasons to use an AI-driven meeting notes platform is to obtain accurate and high-quality transcriptions. Choose a platform that consistently delivers near-perfect transcriptions and can handle various accents and languages. This will ensure that your team can easily understand and refer to the meeting notes.
Integration with Popular Meeting Platforms
It is essential to choose a platform that integrates seamlessly with your existing meeting tools, such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, WebEx, and BlueJeans. This will enable your team to easily access and manage meeting notes without disrupting their workflow.
User-friendly Interface
A user-friendly interface is crucial for a smooth and efficient user experience. Look for a platform that offers an intuitive design and easy navigation, allowing your team to quickly access and utilize the platform's features.
Customizability and Adaptability to Specific Business Needs
Every business has unique requirements, and your chosen AI-driven meeting notes platform should be able to cater to those needs. Opt for a solution that is customizable and adaptable, enabling you to tailor its features according to your specific requirements.
Data Security and Privacy
Ensure that the platform you choose prioritizes data security and privacy. Look for industry-leading encryption and storage policies to protect your company's sensitive information and maintain compliance with data protection regulations.
Pricing and Scalability
Finally, consider the pricing and scalability of the platform. Select a solution that offers a flexible pricing structure, allowing you to scale up or down as your business needs evolve. Additionally, check for any hidden costs or long-term contracts that might impact your budget.
Top Features of AI-driven Meeting Notes Platforms
As you evaluate different AI-driven meeting notes platforms for your business, it is essential to consider the key features that can contribute to a seamless and efficient meeting experience. Some of the most significant features to look for in a platform are:
Automated Transcription Services
A reliable AI-driven platform should offer accurate and high-quality automated transcription services. This feature enables businesses to obtain near-perfect transcriptions of their meetings, ensuring that critical information is captured and accessible for future reference.
AI-Powered Meeting Assistant
An AI-powered meeting assistant can significantly enhance the efficiency of your meetings. This feature can answer questions, summarize key topics, and craft follow-up emails, helping your team stay on track and focused on the most important aspects of the meeting.
Action Item Tracking and Follow-up
Efficient action item tracking and follow-up capabilities are essential for any AI-driven meeting notes platform. This feature allows you to easily identify and monitor the progress of tasks assigned during the meeting, ensuring accountability and timely completion of projects.
Integration with Third-Party Services
Seamless integration with third-party services is crucial for a smooth and efficient workflow. Ensure that the platform you choose can integrate with your existing tools, such as calendar applications, project management software, and communication platforms, to avoid disruptions in your team's productivity.
Intelligent Meeting Search
An intelligent meeting search feature allows users to quickly locate specific moments or topics within a meeting. This can be especially useful for reviewing critical information, clarifying misunderstandings, and ensuring that all team members are on the same page.
Multi-Language Support
For businesses operating in a global environment, multi-language support is a valuable feature. Choose a platform that can handle various languages and accents, enabling your team to communicate effectively and work together seamlessly, regardless of their location or native language.
Circleback: A Comprehensive Solution for Efficient and Accurate Note-Taking
Circleback offers a range of powerful features and benefits designed to enhance the meeting experience for businesses across various industries. As a trusted AI-driven meeting notes platform, Circleback has earned the appreciation of top-performing teams and professionals, including success coaches, CEOs, and sales executives, for its effectiveness and ease of use.

Comparing Circleback with Other AI-driven Meeting Notes Platforms
While Circleback offers a comprehensive solution for efficient and accurate note-taking, it is essential to consider other AI-driven meeting notes platforms on the market to make an informed decision. In this section, we will compare Circleback with several other popular platforms, including Fireflies.ai, Otter.ai, Fathom, Avoma, Sembly AI, and Krisp.
Fireflies.ai
Fireflies.ai is an AI-driven platform known for its advanced features and robust transcription capabilities. While Circleback focuses on providing well-organized notes and action items, Fireflies.ai offers more advanced features such as sentiment analysis and keyword detection. However, both platforms prioritize accuracy and seamless integration with popular meeting tools.
Otter.ai
Otter.ai is another popular choice for AI-driven meeting notes, focusing on providing accurate transcriptions and an intuitive user interface. While Circleback offers additional features such as AI-powered meeting assistance and action item tracking, Otter.ai excels in its core transcription capabilities and user-friendly design.
Fathom
Fathom is a free AI meeting assistant that offers basic transcription and meeting notes capabilities. While Circleback provides a more comprehensive solution with additional features, Fathom may be suitable for businesses with limited budgets or simpler meeting note requirements.
Avoma
Avoma stands out for its conversation analysis and insights, offering in-depth analytics and understanding of meeting dynamics. While Circleback focuses on delivering accurate transcriptions and well-organized notes, Avoma delves deeper into conversation analysis, providing valuable insights to improve communication and collaboration within teams.
Sembly AI
Sembly AI specializes in creating comprehensive meeting summaries and minutes. While Circleback offers a similar level of accuracy and organization in its notes, Sembly AI focuses specifically on crafting detailed summaries that capture the essence of the meeting. This platform may be more suitable for businesses requiring extensive documentation of their meetings.
Krisp
Krisp is an AI-driven platform that focuses on providing high-quality meeting audio, ensuring crystal-clear communication during meetings. While Circleback and Krisp both prioritize accuracy and seamless integration, Circleback offers a broader range of features, including transcription services, AI-powered meeting assistance, and action item tracking.
In conclusion, it is essential to carefully evaluate each platform's unique offerings and capabilities and consider your specific business needs when selecting an AI-driven meeting notes platform. Circleback offers a comprehensive solution for businesses seeking accurate, well-organized notes and powerful meeting management features.

Automatically update HubSpot with meeting notes and action items
July 22, 2024
Automation
In this guide, we'll show you how to automatically update HubSpot records (i.e. contacts, deals) with meeting notes, action items, and other insights after your client or prospect meetings end, ensuring your team has the latest information and follow-up tasks directly in HubSpot.
This is actually pretty straightforward to do with workflows in Circleback, let's get started.
Login to Circleback
. Don't worry if you don't have an account yet, it takes about 2 minutes to create one.
Go to Workflows from the navigation menu on the left.
Create a workflow.
By default, the workflow will run after every meeting. If you'd like, you can choose to have it run after meetings with certain tags or participants. Choose the relevant filters and continue. You can always update this later.
Select Update HubSpot.
If you haven't yet, connect HubSpot.
Once you've connected HubSpot, select whether you want Circleback to automatically update contacts or deals in HubSpot. Circleback looks up the relevant records using the meeting invitees' emails.
Toggle on meeting notes and/or action items and select Done. You can also include outcomes from other insights in the workflow as well.
Select End the workflow.
Give your workflow a name at the top and press Create in the top right.
That's it! Next time you use Circleback in a meeting, relevant records in HubSpot will be automatically updated with the meeting outcomes you chose.

Notion database integration
May 17, 2024
You can now use workflows in Circleback to automatically update Notion databases and tables.
To get started, select Update Notion in an existing or new workflow and choose a database you'd like to update. Once you've selected a database, you can choose an outcome to update each database property (column in the table) with.
For each property, you can choose outcomes related to the meeting, action items, or insights. If you have insights defined in the same workflow, you can map the insight or specific fields from the insight to a database property.
When there are multiple action items or insights associated with a meeting, a new row will be inserted for each.

Automatically update Attio with meeting notes and action items
July 22, 2024
Automation
In this guide, we'll show you how to automatically update Attio objects (i.e. people, companies) with meeting notes, action items, and other insights after your client or prospect meetings end, ensuring your team has the latest information and follow-up tasks directly in Attio.
This is actually pretty straightforward to do with workflows in Circleback, let's get started.
Login to Circleback
. Don't worry if you don't have an account yet, it takes about 2 minutes to create one.
Go to Workflows from the navigation menu on the left.
Create a workflow.
By default, the workflow will run after every meeting. If you'd like, you can choose to have it run after meetings with certain tags or participants. Choose the relevant filters and continue. You can always update this later.
Select Update Attio.
If you haven't yet, connect Attio.
Once you've connected HubSpot, select whether you want Circleback to automatically update people or companies in Attio. Circleback looks up the relevant records using the meeting invitees' emails.
Toggle on meeting notes and/or action items and select Done. You can also include outcomes from other insights in the workflow as well.
Select End the workflow.
Give your workflow a name at the top and press Create in the top right.
That's it! Next time you use Circleback in a meeting, relevant objects in Attio will be automatically updated with the meeting outcomes you chose.

Overview of Tips and Best Practices for Effective Meeting Minutes
Throughout this article, we'll explore practical tips and best practices to help you become a master of minute-taking, including preparation strategies, recording techniques, and finalizing and distributing your minutes effectively.
Preparation for Taking Effective Meeting Minutes
Preparing for the task of taking meeting minutes is crucial to ensure accuracy and efficiency in your note-taking. By understanding the meeting's purpose, reviewing the agenda, gathering necessary materials, and familiarizing yourself with attendees' information, you will be well-equipped to take effective meeting minutes.
Understanding the Purpose of the Meeting
Knowing the meeting's objectives allows you to focus on capturing relevant information, while anticipating the flow of discussions. This understanding helps you prioritize key points and decisions made during the meeting.
Reviewing the Agenda and Creating an Outline
Obtain the meeting agenda beforehand and use it to create an outline for your minutes. This approach ensures you cover all topics and can easily organize your notes, making the process more efficient.
Gathering Necessary Materials and Backup Methods
Ensure you have the appropriate tools for taking notes, whether it's a laptop, notebook, or recording device. Additionally, have backup methods in place, such as extra pens or a secondary recording device, to avoid losing important information due to technical issues or unforeseen circumstances.
Familiarizing Oneself with Attendees' Names, Positions, and Roles
Knowing who is attending the meeting and their respective roles helps you accurately attribute statements and identify decision-makers. This knowledge is essential for producing reliable minutes and fostering clear communication within the organization.
Recording Important Information During the Meeting
During the meeting, it's crucial to focus on capturing significant details that will provide an accurate record of the discussions and decisions made. By concentrating on major issues, actions, and decisions, differentiating between facts and opinions, noting motions and voting outcomes, and incorporating visual aids when relevant, you will create comprehensive and reliable meeting minutes.
Focusing on Major Issues, Actions, and Decisions
Keep your attention on the critical aspects of the meeting, such as key points raised, actions assigned, and decisions made. This focus will ensure that your minutes provide a valuable reference for future meetings and decision-making processes.
Differentiating Between Facts and Opinions
When taking minutes, it's essential to distinguish between objective facts and subjective opinions. Record factual information and key decisions, while avoiding personal biases and unnecessary details.
Noting Motions, Proposals, and Voting Outcomes
Accurately document any motions or proposals made during the meeting, as well as the voting results for each item. This information will help maintain transparency and accountability within your organization.
Incorporating Visual Aids and Whiteboard Drawings When Relevant
If the meeting includes visual aids or whiteboard drawings, include images or descriptions of these elements in your minutes. This practice ensures that all relevant information is captured and accessible for those who were unable to attend the meeting.
Techniques for Concise and Accurate Minute-Taking
Effective minute-taking requires a balance of conciseness and accuracy. By using simple language, maintaining a neutral tone, summarizing key points, and seeking clarification when necessary, you can create meeting minutes that are both informative and easy to understand.
Using Simple Language and Clear Wording
Keep your language straightforward and concise, using clear wording to convey the essential information. This approach ensures that your minutes are easily understood by all members of your organization.
Remaining Neutral and Objective in the Minutes
Maintain a professional and unbiased tone in your minutes, avoiding personal opinions or unnecessary details. Focus on recording factual information, decisions, and actions, ensuring the integrity of the meeting record.
Summarizing Key Points and Decisions Made During Discussions
Provide a summary of the major points and decisions made during each discussion, capturing the essence of the conversation without delving into excessive detail. This technique allows readers to quickly grasp the essential takeaways from the meeting.
Asking for Clarification When Needed
Don't hesitate to ask for clarification during the meeting if you're unsure about a point or decision. This practice ensures that your minutes accurately reflect the intentions and decisions of the participants, contributing to effective communication within your organization.
Finalizing and Distributing Meeting Minutes
After the meeting, it's essential to finalize and distribute your minutes promptly and accurately. Ensuring that your minutes are typed up, proofread, approved, and sent to relevant individuals in a timely manner will contribute to your organization's efficiency and communication.
Promptly Typing Up the Minutes to Ensure Accuracy and Retention of Information
As soon as possible after the meeting, type up your minutes to prevent forgetting essential details. This practice helps maintain the accuracy and completeness of your meeting record.
Proofreading the Minutes for Clarity, Professionalism, and Correctness
Before distributing the minutes, carefully proofread them for clarity, professionalism, and correctness. This step ensures that your minutes provide a reliable and polished representation of the meeting's discussions and decisions.
Obtaining Approval from the Meeting's Chair or Facilitator
Before sending out the minutes, obtain approval from the meeting's chair or facilitator to ensure that your record accurately reflects the proceedings and agreements reached during the meeting.

Distribute the approved minutes promptly to all relevant individuals, ensuring that they have access to the information needed for informed decision-making and effective collaboration within your organization.

Your meeting minutes should be easy to understand. Avoid jargon and keep your notes clear and to the point.
Distribute the minutes promptly
Send out the meeting minutes as soon as possible after the meeting. This helps ensure that everyone remembers what was discussed and knows what they need to do next.
Automated meeting minutes templates
Using a template for meeting minutes can make the task of recording what happens in a meeting much easier. By choosing the right template and using it effectively, you can ensure that your meeting minutes are clear, comprehensive, and useful.
Want to make taking meeting minutes even easier? Circleback transcribes your virtual meetings and automatically generates a summary of the content in whichever format you find useful so you can focus on what matters.

Automatically send meeting notes and action items to Slack
February 6, 2024
Automation
In this guide, we'll show you how to automatically share meeting notes and action items in Slack after your Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or even in-person meeting ends, making sure your team is aware of what was discussed and who will be doing what.
This is actually pretty straightforward to do with workflows in Circleback, let's get started.
Login to Circleback
. Don't worry if you don't have an account yet, it takes about 2 minutes to create one.
Go to Workflows from the navigation menu on the left.
Create a workflow.
By default, the workflow will run after every meeting. If you'd like, you can choose to have it run after meetings with certain tags or participants. Choose the relevant filters and continue. You can always update this later.
Select Send notes to Slack.
If you haven't yet, connect the Slack workspace you want to send your notes to.
Once you've connected your workspace, select the Slack channel you want Circleback to automatically the send the notes to. If you're looking to send notes to private channel, you'll need to add the Circleback bot for Slack to the channel first. You can do this by typing @Circleback in the channel and inviting Circleback.
Toggle on meeting notes and/or action items and select Done.
Select End the workflow.
Give your workflow a name at the top and press Create in the top right.
That's it! Next time you use Circleback in a meeting, the notes and action items will be sent to the Slack channel you chose once the meeting is over. You can set up multiple workflows if you'd like to send notes for different types of meetings to different channels.
Quick note:
Circleback uses AI to generate meeting summaries and action items. While we strive for accuracy, please be aware that AI-generated content may occasionally contain inaccuracies. We recommend reviewing the output for critical information.

Workflows
February 15, 2024
Your meetings have a lot of useful information in them (a goldmine, if you will). We've built workflows to help you find and automatically action on the parts most important to you.
Workflows on Circleback combine two powerful capabilities:
Insights
There are certain things you care about across different types of meetings you're in. If you're talking to potential a customer for the first time, you might want to gather context on how their business works. What industry are they in? How many people work at the company? Workflows allow you to easily capture this information.
Insights generated will show up in a new tab for each meeting. We'll soon be releasing the ability to view insights across different meetings in one place.
Integrations
We've introduced integrations with a handful of platformsâSlack, Notion, Linear, HubSpot, and Salesforceâwhich you can quickly configure through workflows.
Insights and integrations, combined in a workflow, can automate a wide range of tasks. Some examples include:
Send action items to the relevant team's Slack channel
Create a page in Notion with the meeting notes and customer industry
Create Linear issues for action items and feature requests that came up during a demo call
Update HubSpot with the meeting notes and customer industry
Workflows can run after every meeting or ones with selected tags and participants. The applicable workflows will run when a tag is either manually or
automatically applied
to a meeting.
This is just the beginningâwe're working on improving how insights are generated and surfaced, smartening up our existing integrations, and adding support for new integrations. We're excited to work with you to make workflows a powerful tool for getting things done.

Unlocking the full potential of Microsoft Teams meetings with Circleback
November 20, 2023
Meetings
Introduction
As remote work continues to flourish, Microsoft Teams meetings have become essential for effective collaboration and communication. However, traditional meeting management and note-taking methods often struggle to keep pace in this virtual environment. Integrating Circleback AI into Microsoft Teams meetings unlocks a new level of efficiency and productivity. With Circleback's AI-driven features, teams can overcome the limitations of traditional practices and experience the full potential of their virtual meetings.
Challenges of Traditional Meeting Note-Taking
In the age of virtual meetings, the difficulties of traditional meeting note-taking have only become more apparent. One of the most common issues is human error and inconsistencies in the notes. Even the most diligent note-takers can miss important details or misinterpret information, leading to inaccuracies and confusion.
Another challenge is the difficulty in capturing all relevant information and action items during the meeting. With multiple people speaking, sharing ideas, and assigning tasks, it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. As a result, critical points may be lost or not addressed promptly, affecting the overall productivity and effectiveness of the team.
Time management is also a major concern. The process of taking notes during a meeting can be time-consuming and inefficient, leaving less time for active participation and engagement. Additionally, it can be difficult for note-takers to balance the dual responsibility of documenting the discussion and actively participating in the meeting. This lack of focus can result in missed opportunities for contribution and collaboration.
By addressing these challenges, Circleback AI offers a powerful solution that enhances the meeting experience for Microsoft Teams users, enabling them to unlock the full potential of their virtual meetings.

You can configure this from Settings â Calendar.
Automatic sharing

Unified meeting records for teams
June 21, 2024
We've made it simpler for teams on Circleback to manage their meetings.
Previously, when multiple team members used Circleback for a meeting, separate meeting records were created for each member. This resulted in multiple copies of the same meeting, leading to a lack of a single source of truth.
Starting today, when you attend a meeting with other members of your team, one meeting record is created in Circleback. All team members who enabled Circleback for the meeting automatically get owner access to this single record.
This change ensures all team members see and update the same meeting information, while reducing clutter.

Circleback, an AI-powered app, revolutionizes the way professionals take and manage meeting minutes, elevating their quality and ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.
The Significance of Effective Minutes of Meeting
Effective minutes of meeting play a vital role in driving productivity and ensuring successful outcomes. They serve as an essential communication tool that fosters understanding among team members, maintains a record of decisions and action items, and facilitates follow-up and accountability.
First and foremost, well-documented meeting minutes ensure clear communication and understanding among team members. They provide a comprehensive summary of the meeting's discussions, decisions, and action items, helping participants stay on the same page. This clarity promotes collaboration and prevents confusion and misunderstandings that could hinder progress.
Another key function of effective meeting minutes is maintaining a record of decisions and action items. This record enables team members to review the meeting's outcomes, track progress, and ensure that tasks are completed as planned. It also provides valuable insights into the decision-making process and rationale, which can inform future discussions and decisions.
Lastly, effective minutes of meeting facilitate follow-up and accountability. By clearly outlining action items and assigning responsibility, team members can stay focused on their tasks and prioritize their work. Additionally, meeting minutes serve as a reference point for managers and team leaders to monitor progress, identify potential bottlenecks, and hold team members accountable for their responsibilities.
In conclusion, effective minutes of meeting are crucial for fostering clear communication, maintaining accurate records, and promoting accountability within teams. By leveraging the power of Circleback's AI-driven features, professionals can elevate their meeting minutes' quality and efficiency, ensuring that their teams remain productive and focused on achieving their goals.
Key Elements of a Great Meeting Minutes Layout
A well-structured meeting minutes layout is crucial for capturing and presenting information effectively. It ensures that the essential details are easy to locate and comprehend, facilitating better communication among team members. The key elements of a great meeting minutes layout include agenda items and discussion topics, decisions made and action items assigned, attendees and absentees, and the time, date, and location of the meeting.
The first component of an effective meeting minutes layout is the inclusion of agenda items and discussion topics. Clearly outlining these points helps keep the meeting on track and ensures that all important subjects are addressed. Additionally, listing the agenda items and discussion topics in the minutes serves as a reference for participants to remember what was discussed and provides context for any decisions made.
Another important element of a great meeting minutes layout is the documentation of decisions made and action items assigned. This information is crucial for maintaining accountability and ensuring that tasks are completed as planned. By clearly outlining decisions and action items, team members can easily review and track their responsibilities, stay focused on their tasks, and prioritize their work accordingly.
A comprehensive meeting minutes layout should also include details about attendees, absentees, and apologies. This information helps establish who was present and aware of the decisions made during the meeting, as well as who may need to be briefed on the discussions that took place. Recording this information is especially important for maintaining clear communication and understanding among team members.
Lastly, the time, date, and location of the meeting should be included in the meeting minutes layout. This information is essential for providing context and maintaining accurate records. It helps participants remember when the meeting took place and serves as a reference point for future meetings or follow-up discussions.
In conclusion, a great meeting minutes layout is essential for capturing and presenting information effectively. By incorporating agenda items and discussion topics, decisions made and action items assigned, attendees and absentees, and the time, date, and location of the meeting, professionals can create informative and organized minutes that enhance communication, facilitate follow-up, and drive productivity.
Tips for Taking Effective Meeting Minutes
Creating high-quality meeting minutes requires a combination of active listening, note-taking skills, and organizational strategies. Below are several tips to help professionals take effective meeting minutes and enhance their team's productivity.
The Importance of Active Listening and Note-Taking
Effective meeting minutes begin with active listening, which involves focusing on the speaker, absorbing their message, and identifying the most important points. Active listening enables professionals to accurately capture the key information from a meeting and avoid misunderstandings. Combining active listening with note-taking skills ensures that crucial details are documented and can be easily reviewed and acted upon by team members.
Capturing Essential Information without Overloading on Details
When taking meeting minutes, it's important to strike a balance between capturing essential information and avoiding information overload. Focus on documenting the main points, decisions made, action items, and responsible parties. Overloading the minutes with excessive details can make it difficult for team members to identify the most important takeaways and hinder productivity.
Using Templates and Shorthand for Efficiency
Utilizing templates and shorthand can streamline the note-taking process and improve the consistency of meeting minutes. Templates help ensure that all crucial information is captured and presented in a clear, organized manner. Shorthand techniques, such as abbreviations and symbols, can expedite note-taking and make it easier to keep up with the pace of the meeting.
Reviewing and Editing Minutes for Clarity and Accuracy
After the meeting, it's essential to review and edit the minutes for clarity and accuracy. This step helps ensure that the information is presented in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand format and that any errors or omissions are corrected. By refining the minutes, professionals can create a valuable resource that enhances communication and productivity within their team.
In conclusion, taking effective meeting minutes is a critical skill for maximizing productivity in today's fast-paced business environment. By actively listening, capturing essential information, using templates and shorthand, and reviewing and editing the minutes, professionals can create high-quality documents that drive action and collaboration within their teams.

Circleback vs. Fireflies: making the best choice for your meeting notes
July 13, 2023
Meetings
Introduction
Choosing the right tool for taking notes in meetings is crucial for your business. It can help you work more efficiently and get more done. At Circleback, we understand this need and strive to provide the best solution. In this article, we'll compare Circleback and Fireflies.ai to help you understand the unique strengths of each.
Overview of Circleback

With a clean and simple design, advanced search features, and an integrated feature for follow-up emails, we aim to streamline your meetings and help your team stay on track.
Overview of Fireflies.ai
Fireflies.ai is another tool in this space. It joins your meetings, takes notes, and provides insights. With many integrations and features, Fireflies.ai offers a comprehensive solution for managing meetings. It's also cheaper, with a free plan and a starting price of $18/month compared to Circlebackâs $25/month.
Feature Comparison
Let's look at the main features of Circleback and Fireflies.ai:
Cost
: Fireflies.ai is has a starting price of $18/month vs Circleback at $25/month.
Quality of Notes
: At Circleback, we provide detailed, customizable summaries of your meetings. This means you get all the information you need without having to read through long transcripts or listen to long recordings. Fireflies.ai also gives you meeting notes. Some users find them a bit short, but they come with extra features like talk time analysis.
Design
: We pride ourselves on Circleback's simple, clean design. Fireflies.ai has more features in its design, which some users find too busy, but others might like because it gives them more insights.
Follow-Up Email
: Both Circleback and Fireflies.ai send follow-up emails. Our email at Circleback includes all the information from the meeting so everyone has the information they need post-call. Fireflies.ai's email sends users to their website for all the information, creating more steps.
Search Features
: At Circleback, we offer great search features for finding information from past meetings. Our search works like ChatGPT where you can ask questions like "what did Moody say his budget & top challenges were?" or "who told me they wanted campaign optimizations by Friday?â Fireflies.ai also has a search feature, which some users find a bit better than basic search but not as advanced as they would like.
Data Storage: A Key Consideration
For businesses, especially those in Canada, where data is stored can be a big factor in choosing a meeting management tool. This is because of rules and privacy laws that say certain types of data must be stored within the country.
Fireflies.ai currently stores data only in the United States. While this may be fine for many businesses, it could be a problem for Canadian companies that need to make sure their data is stored within Canada.
In contrast, at Circleback, we offer data storage in both the United States and Canada. This flexibility lets us meet the needs of more businesses, including those in Canada that have specific data storage requirements.
Who Should Use Which Tool?
Fireflies is a good fit for larger organizations and teams, as well as for individuals who prefer having an audio recording.
Circleback is better for more agile teams, including project managers, salespeople, agencies, investors, and administrative staff at companies with fewer than 1,000 employees.
Unique Benefits of Using Circleback
At Circleback, we offer benefits that go beyond just taking meeting notes. Here's how we can make a real difference in your day-to-day work:

How to take effective meeting minutes
July 10, 2023
Meetings
Effective meeting minutes
Meeting minutes are an essential part of any business meeting. They serve as a record of what was discussed, what decisions were made, and what actions need to be taken. However, taking effective meeting minutes can be a challenge. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process step by step.
Why meeting minutes matter
Meeting minutes are more than just a record of a meeting. They can serve as a source of information for those who couldn't attend the meeting, a reference for those who need to recall what was discussed, and a guide for future action. Effective meeting minutes can help ensure everyone is on the same page and that no important details are forgotten.
What to include in meeting minutes
Date and Time
: The date and time of the meeting.
Attendees
: A list of who attended the meeting and who was absent.
Agenda Items
: A summary of each item that was discussed.
Decisions Made
: Any decisions that were made during the meeting.
Action Items
: Tasks that need to be completed, who is responsible for them, and when they're due.
Next Meeting
: The date and time of the next meeting, if applicable.
How to take effective meeting minutes
Come Prepared
: Review the meeting agenda beforehand and understand what's expected from the meeting.
Note Key Points
: Don't try to write down everything. Instead, focus on the key points, decisions, and action items.
Use a Consistent Format
: This makes your minutes easier to read and understand.
Review and Revise
: Review your notes after the meeting and make any necessary revisions.
Distribute Quickly
: Send out the meeting minutes as soon as possible so that everyone can review them while the meeting is still fresh in their minds.
Automated meeting minutes
Taking effective meeting minutes is a skill that can be developed with practice. By following these tips, you can ensure that your meeting minutes are clear, concise, and useful for everyone involved.
Want to make taking meeting minutes even easier? Circleback transcribes your virtual meetings and automatically generates a summary of the content in whichever format you find useful so you can focus on what matters.

Mastering meeting notes: the art of effective communication and decision-making
August 21, 2023
Meetings
In today's fast-paced business world, effective communication and decision-making are crucial for the success of any organization. Meetings play a pivotal role in facilitating these processes, serving as platforms for collaboration, idea generation, and problem-solving. However, without proper documentation and follow-up, the valuable insights and decisions made during meetings can easily be lost or forgotten.
This is where meeting notes come into play. Meeting notes are written records that capture the key points, discussions, decisions, and action items from a meeting. They serve as a valuable resource for participants to refer back to, ensure accountability, and maintain alignment on next steps. In essence, mastering the art of taking effective meeting notes is essential for enhancing communication and decision-making within an organization.
Section 1: Introduction to Meeting Notes
1.1 Definition and Importance of Meeting Notes
Before diving into the techniques and strategies for effective note-taking, it is important to understand what meeting notes are and why they are important. Meeting notes are concise summaries of a meeting that capture the main points, discussions, decisions, and action items. They serve as a record of what transpired during the meeting and act as a reference point for future discussions.
The importance of meeting notes cannot be overstated. They provide clarity and transparency, ensuring that everyone is on the same page regarding the meeting's outcomes and next steps. Meeting notes also serve as a valuable resource for absent participants to catch up on what they missed and for future reference when reviewing past decisions or tracking progress.
1.2 Types of Meeting Notes
Meeting notes can take various formats, depending on the purpose of the meeting and the desired level of detail. Some common types of meeting notes include minutes, action items, and summary notes.
Minutes are comprehensive records that capture almost every detail of the meeting, including attendees, agenda items, discussions, decisions, and action items. They are typically used for formal meetings, such as board meetings or management team meetings.
Action items focus specifically on the tasks and responsibilities assigned during the meeting. They outline what needs to be done, who is responsible, and the deadline for completion. Action items are particularly useful for project meetings or task-oriented discussions.
Summary notes, on the other hand, provide a condensed version of the meeting, highlighting the key points, decisions, and action items. They are useful for quick reference or when sharing meeting highlights with a larger audience.
Each type of meeting note has its pros and cons, and the choice of format depends on the specific meeting context and objectives. Understanding the different types of meeting notes and when to use them is essential for effective note-taking.
In the following sections, we will explore the strategies and techniques for preparing and taking meeting notes, as well as best practices for post-meeting note management. By mastering these skills, you will not only enhance your own productivity and organization but also contribute to more effective communication and decision-making within your organization. So let's dive in and unlock the art of mastering meeting notes!
Effective Communication and Order Management
Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful meetings. It ensures that participants understand each other, exchange ideas, and work towards common goals. In addition to verbal communication, meeting notes play a vital role in facilitating effective communication and order management within a meeting.
Active Listening and Engaging Discussions
Active listening is a crucial skill for effective communication during meetings. It involves fully focusing on the speaker, understanding their message, and providing appropriate responses. When taking meeting notes, active listening helps you capture accurate information and ensure that the notes reflect the essence of the discussions.
To actively listen during a meeting, it's important to maintain eye contact with the speaker, avoid distractions, and show genuine interest. Take note of the speaker's tone, body language, and key points. By actively engaging in discussions, you not only contribute to the meeting's objectives but also gain a deeper understanding of the topics being discussed.
Facilitating Order and Structure
Meeting notes play a significant role in maintaining order and structure within a meeting. They provide a framework for discussions, ensuring that topics are addressed in a logical sequence and no important points are missed. By structuring your meeting notes with headings and subheadings, you create a roadmap that guides participants through the meeting agenda.
When taking meeting notes, it's important to capture the main points and key takeaways from each agenda item. Use bullet points or numbered lists to organize the information and make it easily readable. This helps participants follow the flow of the meeting and refer back to specific topics when needed.
Capturing Decisions and Action Items
One of the critical aspects of effective order management in meetings is capturing decisions and action items accurately. Meeting notes serve as a record of the decisions made and the tasks assigned during the meeting. By clearly documenting these details, you ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the next steps and responsibilities.
When recording decisions, be specific about what was decided, who made the decision, and any relevant context or considerations. For action items, clearly state the tasks, assign responsibilities, and set deadlines. This not only helps participants remember their assigned tasks but also holds them accountable for their commitments.
Ensuring Clarity and Understanding
Clarity is paramount in effective communication and order management. Meeting notes should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Avoid jargon or technical terms that might confuse readers, especially those who were not present at the meeting. Use plain language and explain any acronyms or industry-specific terminology to ensure comprehension.
Additionally, if there are any points of ambiguity or uncertainty during the meeting, it's essential to clarify them and capture the resolution in the meeting notes. This helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures that the notes accurately reflect the intended messages.
By focusing on effective communication and order management through active listening, structured note-taking, capturing decisions and action items, and ensuring clarity, meeting notes become a powerful tool for successful meetings. They not only serve as a record of discussions but also contribute to accountability, collaboration, and the overall productivity of the team.
Preparing for Taking Meeting Notes
Preparing for taking meeting notes is essential to ensure that you are equipped with the necessary knowledge, tools, and materials to capture the meeting's key points accurately. By investing time in the preparation phase, you set yourself up for success in note-taking and enhance your ability to contribute effectively during the meeting.
Understanding the Meeting Objective
Before attending a meeting, it is crucial to have a clear understanding of the meeting's objective. Take the time to review the meeting agenda and any pre-meeting materials to familiarize yourself with the purpose of the meeting and the desired outcomes. This understanding will help you focus on the relevant discussions and ensure that your notes align with the meeting's objectives.
By knowing the meeting objective, you can anticipate the key topics that will be discussed and prepare yourself to capture the necessary information. This proactive approach allows you to be more engaged during the meeting and provides a framework for organizing your notes effectively.
Familiarizing with Participants and Roles
Another important aspect of preparation is familiarizing yourself with the meeting participants and their respective roles. Knowing who will attend the meeting and their responsibilities allows you to better understand their contributions and ensure accurate attribution in your notes.
Take the time to research the participants and their roles within the organization. This knowledge enables you to identify key stakeholders, decision-makers, and subject matter experts who may play a significant role in the discussions. By understanding the participants' roles, you can capture their perspectives more accurately and provide context in your meeting notes.
Gathering Necessary Materials and Tools
To effectively take meeting notes, it is crucial to have the necessary materials and tools at your disposal. Depending on your preference and the nature of the meeting, you may choose to take notes using pen and paper or leverage digital note-taking apps or software.
If you opt for pen and paper, ensure that you have a notebook or notepad dedicated to meeting notes. Consider using color-coded pens or highlighters to differentiate between different sections or categories of information. Additionally, having sticky notes or tabs can be helpful for marking important pages or sections within your notebook.
For digital note-taking, explore various productivity apps or software that offer features like real-time collaboration, organization, and search functionality. Find a tool that suits your needs and become familiar with its features before the meeting. This way, you can focus on capturing information rather than struggling with the technology during the meeting.
In addition to materials and tools, make sure you have access to important documents, agendas, and any previous meeting notes related to the topic. Having these resources readily available ensures that you can reference them during the meeting and capture accurate information.
By understanding the meeting objective, familiarizing yourself with participants and their roles, and gathering the necessary materials and tools, you lay a solid foundation for effective note-taking. This preparation allows you to enter the meeting with confidence, ready to capture the essential information and contribute meaningfully to the discussions.
Effective Note-Taking Techniques
Taking effective meeting notes requires a combination of active listening, organization, and capturing key information efficiently. By employing the following note-taking techniques, you can enhance your ability to capture and retain information accurately during the meeting.
Active Listening and Note-Taking Strategies
Active listening is a fundamental skill for effective note-taking. During the meeting, focus on the speaker and actively engage in the discussion. Take note of the main points, ideas, and any supporting arguments or evidence presented. Avoid getting caught up in trying to write everything down verbatim and instead focus on capturing the essence of the discussions.
To maximize your note-taking efficiency, use a combination of strategies such as shorthand, symbols, and abbreviations. Develop a system that works for you, allowing you to jot down key points quickly. For example, using an arrow to indicate cause and effect, or an exclamation mark to highlight important information. This helps you capture information in real-time without falling behind the conversation.
Structuring Meeting Notes
Organizing your meeting notes is essential for easy comprehension and reference. Structure your notes in a logical and hierarchical manner using headings and subheadings. Start with a clear title that reflects the meeting topic, followed by sections for each agenda item or discussion point.
Within each section, use bullet points or numbered lists to capture key ideas and supporting details. Consider using indentation or indentation levels to represent the hierarchy of information. This way, you can quickly scan your notes and find specific information when reviewing them later.
Additionally, consider using formatting techniques such as bold or italicized text to emphasize important points or distinguish action items from general discussions. These visual cues help draw attention to critical information and make your notes more visually appealing and easy to navigate.
Capturing Key Information
When taking meeting notes, it's important to capture the most relevant and essential information accurately. Focus on recording decisions, action items, and any key conclusions or recommendations made during the meeting. Be concise but thorough in your note-taking, avoiding unnecessary details or lengthy explanations.
For decisions, clearly state what was decided, who made the decision, and any relevant context or considerations. Capture action items by specifying the task, assigning responsibilities, and setting deadlines. Include any additional information necessary for the successful completion of the task, such as dependencies or resources needed.
When summarizing discussions, focus on the main points and key arguments. Avoid verbatim transcription and instead aim to capture the essence of the conversation. Use your listening skills to identify the most important points and articulate them concisely in your notes.
Timestamps and Time References
Including timestamps or time references in your meeting notes can be beneficial when reviewing or referencing the discussions. Timestamps can help track the progress of the meeting, identify when decisions were made, or refer back to specific points in the discussion.
If possible, note down the time when significant events occur, such as the start and end of the meeting or when key decisions are made. Additionally, use time references when referring to specific parts of the meeting or when capturing time-sensitive information.
By employing active listening and note-taking strategies, structuring your meeting notes effectively, capturing key information accurately, and incorporating timestamps or time references, you can optimize your note-taking process and ensure that your meeting notes are comprehensive and useful references for future discussions and actions.
Post-Meeting Note Management
Effective note-taking doesn't end with the conclusion of the meeting. Proper post-meeting note management is essential to ensure that the captured information is accurate, accessible, and actionable. By following best practices for reviewing, editing, distributing, and tracking meeting notes, you can maximize the value of your meeting documentation.
Reviewing and Editing Meeting Notes
After the meeting, it's important to review and edit your meeting notes for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Take the time to go through your notes, comparing them with any supporting documents, agendas, or previous meeting notes. Fill in any gaps, correct any errors, and ensure that the notes reflect the discussions and decisions accurately.
During the review process, pay attention to the flow and organization of your notes. Ensure that the sections and headings make sense and are easy to follow. Consider restructuring or reordering the information if necessary to improve the readability and coherence of your notes.
Editing your meeting notes also involves removing any redundant or unnecessary information. While it's important to capture the key points and details, aim for conciseness and avoid including irrelevant or repetitive content. This helps streamline your notes and makes them more digestible for future reference.
Distributing Meeting Notes
Once you have reviewed and edited your meeting notes, it's time to distribute them to the relevant stakeholders. Determine who should receive the meeting notes based on their involvement or interest in the discussed topics. This may include meeting participants, team members, supervisors, or other relevant individuals.
Choose the appropriate format for sharing the meeting notes. This could be through email, document sharing platforms, or collaboration tools. Consider the confidentiality and security of the information when deciding on the distribution method, especially when dealing with sensitive or confidential matters.
When sharing meeting notes, provide a brief summary or overview of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting. This helps recipients quickly grasp the main points without having to read through the entire document. Include any attachments or supporting documents that are relevant to the discussions for easy reference.
Follow-Up and Action Item Tracking
One of the key purposes of meeting notes is to facilitate follow-up and action item tracking. After the meeting, it's important to ensure that the assigned tasks and responsibilities are carried out effectively. Use your meeting notes as a reference to monitor the progress of action items and follow up with the relevant individuals or teams.
Assigning responsibilities and deadlines is crucial for effective action item tracking. Clearly communicate the assigned tasks, the individuals responsible, and the expected completion dates. Regularly check in with the responsible parties to provide support or address any obstacles they may encounter.
Consider using project management or task tracking tools to facilitate action item tracking. These tools help you monitor the status of tasks, set reminders, and provide visibility to all relevant stakeholders. Integrating your meeting notes with these tools ensures that the action items are not forgotten and that progress is effectively monitored.
By reviewing and editing your meeting notes, distributing them to the appropriate stakeholders, and actively tracking action items, you maximize the value of your meeting documentation. This post-meeting note management process ensures that the discussions and decisions are translated into actionable tasks, leading to effective implementation and progress towards meeting objectives.
Best Practices for Effective Meeting Notes
To elevate your meeting notes to the next level, it's important to follow best practices that enhance their effectiveness and usefulness. By incorporating these practices into your note-taking routine, you can ensure that your meeting notes contribute to improved communication, collaboration, and decision-making within your organization.
Collaboration and Teamwork
Meeting notes should not be solely the responsibility of one person. Encouraging collaboration and teamwork in note-taking allows for a more comprehensive and accurate capture of the meeting discussions. Assign roles or rotate note-taking duties among participants to ensure diverse perspectives are reflected in the notes.
Promote a collaborative note-taking environment by encouraging participants to contribute to the meeting notes. Encourage them to add any key points or details they feel are important and verify the accuracy of the captured information. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among the meeting participants and ensures a more comprehensive record of the discussions.
Additionally, consider using collaborative note-taking tools that allow multiple people to contribute to the same document simultaneously. This facilitates real-time collaboration and ensures that all participants have access to the most up-to-date version of the meeting notes.
Overcoming Challenges and Difficult Situations
Meetings can sometimes be challenging, with interruptions, side conversations, or unclear discussions. As a note-taker, it's important to navigate these situations effectively to ensure accurate and meaningful meeting notes.
If interruptions occur, make a note of them in your meeting notes, but try to focus on capturing the main points of the discussion. Politely redirect the conversation back to the agenda item at hand to maintain the flow of the meeting.
In situations where side conversations or off-topic discussions arise, tactfully steer the conversation back to the meeting agenda. Politely remind participants of the meeting's purpose and encourage them to address the side topic separately.
During unclear discussions, ask for clarification or seek additional information to ensure that the captured notes accurately represent the intended messages. Use active listening techniques to grasp the main points and ask open-ended questions to encourage further explanation if needed.
Staying Focused and Organized
Fast-paced meetings can be overwhelming, making it challenging to keep up with note-taking and organization. To stay focused and organized, consider employing strategies such as using headings and subheadings, color-coding, or creating templates.
Using headings and subheadings helps break down the meeting discussions into logical sections, making it easier to navigate your notes later. Color-coding different sections or categories of information can help visually distinguish them and aid in quick reference. Creating templates or frameworks for different types of meetings or agenda items streamlines your note-taking process and ensures consistency.
Additionally, consider utilizing technology tools that offer features like automatic organization, search functionality, and integration with calendars or task management systems. These tools can help streamline your note-taking process and keep you organized, even in fast-paced meetings.
By fostering collaboration, overcoming challenges, and staying focused and organized, you can enhance the effectiveness of your meeting notes. Implementing these best practices ensures that your notes are comprehensive, accurate, and valuable resources for future reference and decision-making.
Technology Tools for Meeting Notes
In today's digital age, technology has revolutionized the way we take and manage meeting notes. With a plethora of note-taking apps and software available, leveraging technology tools can significantly enhance the efficiency and accessibility of meeting notes. Let's explore some popular options and their features.
Digital Note-Taking Apps
Digital note-taking apps offer a range of features that go beyond traditional pen and paper. These apps allow you to create, edit, and organize your meeting notes digitally, providing flexibility and convenience. Some popular digital note-taking apps include Evernote, Microsoft OneNote, and Google Keep.
These apps provide a user-friendly interface where you can create separate notebooks or folders for different meetings or projects. You can create and format text, add images, and even record audio or video directly into your notes. The ability to search within your notes and sync them across multiple devices makes retrieving and accessing information a breeze.
Collaboration and Real-Time Editing
Collaboration is an essential aspect of effective meeting notes, and technology tools excel in facilitating real-time collaboration. Apps like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365 allow multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously. This enables participants to contribute to the meeting notes in real-time, ensuring that everyone's perspectives and insights are captured accurately.
Real-time collaboration also promotes transparency and accountability. Participants can see the changes made by others, track the progress of the note-taking process, and engage in discussions within the document itself. This collaborative environment fosters a sense of teamwork and ensures that the meeting notes reflect the collective knowledge and contributions of the participants.
Integration with Task Management and Productivity Tools
Integrating meeting notes with task management and productivity tools can streamline the follow-up process and enhance the effectiveness of action item tracking. Apps like Trello, Asana, or Microsoft Planner allow you to create tasks directly from your meeting notes. This integration eliminates the need for manual transfer of action items, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.
By linking action items to specific tasks or projects, you can assign responsibilities, set due dates, and track progress within the task management tool. This seamless integration saves time, improves accountability, and provides a centralized location for managing and monitoring action items resulting from the meeting.
Mobile Apps for On-the-Go Note-Taking
With the increasing prevalence of remote work and mobile devices, mobile apps for note-taking have become indispensable. Many digital note-taking apps offer mobile versions that allow you to capture meeting notes on your smartphone or tablet. Apps like Evernote, Microsoft OneNote, and Apple Notes offer mobile apps with features such as voice-to-text transcription, image capture, and offline access to your notes.
Mobile note-taking apps provide the flexibility to take notes wherever you are, whether in a meeting room, coffee shop, or while traveling. The ability to access, edit, and sync your notes across multiple devices ensures that you have your meeting notes readily available, regardless of your location.
By leveraging technology tools for meeting notes, you can enhance your note-taking process, streamline collaboration, and improve the overall productivity of your meetings. The convenience, accessibility, and integration capabilities of these tools make them valuable assets for capturing, managing, and leveraging meeting notes effectively.
