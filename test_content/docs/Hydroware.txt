The HydroElite Experience
An elevator should be your security
. As a property owner, you should feel calm knowing that the elevator works and that it will continue to work in the future. On the day something needs to be fixed, you should not be surprised by expensive service costs. A hydraulic elevator from Hydroware is an economically sustainable solution that gives you flexibility.
If the property does not have an elevator, you can install an elevator and thus allow more people to stay longer in their apartments. It is also possible to build an additional floor and install an elevator.
Read more about the possibility of an extension floor here
.
We know modernization
Hydroware, together with our service partners, has carried out many modernizations of hydraulic elevators all over the world. We have solutions for modernization and new installation of elevators and collaborate with both smaller property owners and large international companies. Long experience and a large network of service partners means that you can feel safe in your choice of elevator.
Lower cost
Whether you want to install a new elevator or want to modernize your existing elevator, you can reduce the cost of ownership with our solutions. We deliver an open and modular system, which means that you do not commit to a supplier but can instead keep costs for service and repair down. We also offer financing solutions to give you a worry-free elevator ownership.
M
odernize again and again
After a modernization, the elevator can normally be used for another 25-30 years. Then it is possible to modernize it again. A completely new price-pressed elevator with a leaner frame normally does not last as long, which leads to expensive and extensive repairs in the long run. In addition, a completely new elevator rarely has the possibility to be modernized at all, which means that it will be time for another full replacement after 20-25 years.
Sustainable option
If you have an elevator in the building, you should always modernize and reuse robust and functional parts instead of installing a new elevator. With an elevator modernization from Hydroware, you give the property a more sustainable profile and the environmental impact is about half compared to installing a new elevator. This applies, for example, to elevators in residential buildings with up to 6-7 floors and shopping centers with 4-5 floors and up to 250,000 journeys per year. With our elevators, you can reduce your energy consumption by up to 70% compared to traditional hydraulic elevators. In addition, power consumption can be reduced by up to two-thirds, which results in lower subscription fees – which often make up the major part of an elevators operating costs.

Success story: From a property owner’s perspective
Modernizing the elevators was a success
“The repair costs of our old elevators skyrocketed and it was often difficult to get spare parts. Then we decided to modernize the elevators because it was cheaper and more environmentally friendly.
We kept guides and elevator cabin but replaced drive and control systems, doors and panels “, says Gösta Fridh, vice chairman of the tenant-owner association Ruuth 50 in Helsingborg.
“It has become bright, fresh, more less abled body-friendly and we save around SEK 35,000 per year in reduced energy and power costs. Now the elevators run flawlessly and the residents think it is a success “, says a satisfied Inger Tunström, chairman.

The HydroElite Experience
Flexible elevator
s
Create attractive and durable elevators with a tailor-made solution through Hydroware. With a hydraulic elevator, we can adapt and tailor the elevator to suit your wishes. The hydraulic elevator is a space-efficient solution that takes up less of the property’s area and there are all possibilities for an aesthetically pleasing design. Create the elevator solution you want.
Tailor-made elevator
Passenger elevators are elevators that are intended for passenger transport. These elevators are common in, among other things, apartment buildings, tenant-owner associations, offices and public environments. We offer flexible solutions where we tailor the elevator to your wishes. Hydroware’s solutions are space-efficient and take up less of the property’s space. In this way, our solutions maximize the space in the property that can be used for other purposes. Shape, color, material and shaft dimensions can be adapted completely as needed. We have solutions for
narrow shafts that fit in tight spaces
, minimal elevator pit, low top height and for
machine roomless elevator
, which means that the elevator can get the expression that is sought.
The hydraulic elevator is the architect’s friend
A hydraulic elevator from Hydroware is an energy-efficient elevator with a low environmental impact. The climate impact of a modernized elevator is significantly lower than the alternatives. Keep energy consumption down when operating the elevator and reduce the total cost. An elevator from Hydroware can be modernized again and again. In this way, costs are kept down for the entire lifespan of the elevator. Read more about the
life cycle cost of elevator here
.
Neither load weight nor lifting height limits the design. In buildings with up to 6-7 floors, a hydraulic elevator is preferable. The elevator can handle a load weight of up to 3.5 tonnes and the load from the elevator ends up on the ground slab instead of in the building’s vertical construction.

Success story – Flexible elevators
Skansen Kronan
Skansen Kronan is a building with high cultural values and one of Gothenburg’s foremost landmarks. Now more people can access the fortress through a specially adapted elevator solution from Hydroware.
The product from Hydroware was chosen by our procured contractor Tvåtumfyra to meet the very special requirements of the project, mainly that we could not solve space neither at the bottom nor at the top in the normal way. The result has been very good and we are happy that a high finish was offered so that we create a dignified and accessible new entrance to the building. Hydroware and Vinga were solution-oriented and the few deviations that appeared were handled with good special solutions in collaboration with the builder.
Dan Andersson, technical manager at the National Property Board (Sweden)
The project was carried out together with Vinga Elevator from Gothenburg.

The HydroElite Experience - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
The HydroElite Experience
The HydroElite Experience
is a concept that we at Hydroware have always worked from. We see ourselves not only as a product supplier, but also a partner who is with you throughout the lifespan of the elevator. With The HydroElite Experience, we offer multilingual support throughout the process and we have competent staff available at all levels for you as a customer.
If you ask us at Hydroware, you do not only buy a product – you also buy a long-term sustainable elevator solution that improves the quality of life and makes everyday life a little easier.
Customer needs
Sometimes it can be difficult to know how to proceed and what is the best solution. Older elevators that need to be upgraded do not have to mean high investment costs, long downtime and in the long run expensive service agreements. Whether it is modernization or new elevators, we are here to help you find the best solution.
Measurement
We have developed data and
help tools
that make it easier for you as a customer to make measurements in a simple and efficient way. As a partner, we are with you and answer any questions that arise along the way. Our goal is that together we get the right conditions for a well-executed project.
Offer
With the help of our tools and templates, you can yourself, or together with us, easily communicate the elevator’s specific data needed to obtain a quote for the project. Thanks to our long experience in hydraulic elevators and our efficient processes, we can prepare a complete quote
within 24 hours
.
Order
Thanks to the fact that we have developed a complete product for modernization with drive and control systems, we can provide short lead times. Normally we produce a HydroElite within 4 weeks, but we can also deliver by express within 1-2 weeks. For us, it is important to be able to be flexible, and we can therefore handle minor changes to the order without it having to affect delivery times.
Installation
Another advantage of our combined
HydroElite
drive and control system is that it significantly reduces installation times. All our products are pre-wired and factory tested before delivery.
This in combination with the efficient commissioning and our indicative support means the shortest installation and downtime available in the industry.
Generous support package
In our generous support package, we offer multilingual technical support for both drive and control systems with the option of on-site support assistance when needed. If spare parts are needed, they will be with you
within 24 hours
. In order for you to get to know our products better, we can also offer training in preparation, installation, troubleshooting and service.
For us, nothing is impossible, and we stand for it. We have a long experience of solving projects that others normally say no to. We never give up until you are completely satisfied.
Success story
Hydroware’s system is well thought out
“For me as a elevator fitter, it is easy to work with Hydroware’s system. Everything comes packed and ready for assembly. Just tear out the old parts to be replaced and install the new ones. There will be short assembly times.”
2Hydroware’s system is well thought out and easy to install and start up. Competing systems require a great deal of experience to get started. ”
“Another important thing for us fitters is the support. We can only say that it is very good and with no competition. We needed to replace a part during an assembly in Kristianstad and then someone took the car directly from Hydroware and drove the part down to us. In just over an hour, the problem was solved. “
“There is a reason why Hydroware has grown and that is that they have the best hydraulic system on the market.”
Bosse Wallman and Ingolf Svensson, elevator fitters, give their views on the installation of the drive and control system from Hydroware.

Circular economy for elevators - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Circular economy for elevators
Circular economy is an expression of economic models in a company, society, or organisation, which highlights business opportunities where circular cycles are used rather than linear processes that have been dominant up until now.
An elevator consists of several components with very varying service life. The elevator is normally installed in a very protected environment so the impact from the surroundings is negligible. Components that are not wear and tear parts have a very long service life, such as guides, support frame, elevator car and door panels.
Reuse as much as possible
Build robust modular elevators that can be repaired. When, after 20-30 years, it is time to modernise the elevator, reuse as much as possible. Finally, when all parts are worn out, it’s time to recycle all the material and replace with a brand new one.
Modernize
Hydroware’s elevators are adapted to be modernized again and again. There are many reasons to upgrade the elevator instead of replacing the entire elevator. Read more about all the benefits of
elevator
modernization here
.
Document
Read more on sustainable elevators in our brochure.
Lifecycle for lifts
We have had a life cycle analysis done for a 4-person elevator in a residential building. It clearly shows that the material used to manufacture the lift has a significantly greater negative impact on the environment than that from operation during the property’s lifetime.
Sustainable lifts
For us to move into a sustainable world, we need to go back to installing lifts that are suited for modernisation, where they can be updated module by module. A modernised lift will have half the environmental impact of a completely replaced lift.

Wireless driving handle from Hydroware can be used on all our products and provides an easier installation.
The wireless driving handle from Hydroware can be used on all of our products and will simplify the installation process.
Quick Installation with wireless driving handle
If the Hydroware wireless drive handle is used, the elevator can be operated wirelessly from the cabin roof. Use the elevator as a means of transport during installation as soon as the new system is placed in the machine room, filled with oil, and connected to the mains. Assembly run does not require that shaft material or cabin node is connected. Brackets that are required are already pre-assembled from the factory, so no extra wiring is needed before you can ride with the elevator, which facilitates and speeds up the installation.

VIDI
The top model from Hydroware
HydroElite VIDI
, which is the top model from Hydroware, is an integrated drive and control system for hydraulic elevators. It is equipped with Hydroware’s unique valve system which makes it possible for the elevator to go with direct to floor travel, completely without creeping. The valve also does not need to bypass the oil at full speed upwards. HydroElite VIDI is equipped with an efficient air-cooled IE2 motor and frequency control. The rated speed is gradually reduced when the load exceeds 25 percent of the rated load, which greatly reduces the power requirement.
HydroElite VIDI is available in both H2 and V5 models. H2 is the latest and most innovative lift control system, and it is designed for both the HydroElite H2 and TractionElite H2. With H2, you get one supplier for all your projects, simple installation and a future proof product thanks to our IoT capabilities.

Thanks to accepting that the speed is regulated down slightly from a load of 25%, you can reduce the power requirement up to 70%. According to VDI4707, only 20% of all trips are with more than 25% load. The air-cooled motor and the unique valve’s properties also reduce energy consumption by up to 70% compared to other conventional systems.
Quick installation
HydroElite VIDI is pre-assembled and function tested in our factory, which shortens the installation time. Commissioning is easily done with the help of a learning journey for the hydraulics and one for the floor plan setting. No manual adjustments are required and the valve accuracy increases for each trip.
Increased capacity and comfort
Direct approach to the floor and the fact that no bypass of the oil is needed gives shorter travel time and increased travel capacity. In addition, the reaction time from a command to start is very short due to the fact that the entire system is perfectly tuned, which also helps to increase the elevator’s capacity and comfort.
No overheated oil
Thanks to the valve’s unique properties, more trips can be made without the oil getting too hot. The air-cooled motor helps keep the oil cool. With a HydroElite VIDI, you normally do not have to worry about overheated oil and there is normally no need for an energy-intensive oil cooler.
Safer with one supplier
The fact that the drive and control system come from the same supplier provides increased security and easier handling in terms of support, service and guarantees throughout the lifespan of the elevator.

Quick and easy installation
Manual drive is possible after only a few hours of installation work, depending on your choice of drive and control system. All our products are
pre-assembled, and function tested in our Swedish factories
. In addition, the cables are connected. All this together with the simple commissioning enables up to a
halving of the installation time
compared to traditional systems.
Pre-tested at the factory
All HydroElite and TractionElite are pre-tested on physical elevators in our factories to 100% before delivery. This reduces the risk of possible problems on the construction site while at the same time greatly reducing installation time. Furthermore, the total function is ensured and Hydroware can take responsibility for the entire product and a safe stable function for the entire life of the elevator.
Increased capacity and comfort
Already in the design and construction stage, HydroElite drive, and control systems are married together. This contributes to a short reaction time from command to start, which together with the unique valve’s properties increases
the elevator’s capacity and comfort
.
Self-learning
Commissioning is easily done with the help of a learning journey for the hydraulics and one for the floor plan setting. The system is completely
self-learning and self-adjusting
. No manual changes are required and the valve’s accuracy and precision when running in to floor increases for each trip.
Delivery time
The lead time for a HydroElite is very short. The standard delivery from the time an order is added for a HydroElite to leave the factory in Alvesta is
4-5 weeks
, with a few more weeks for the TractionElite. On request, the HydroElite is available for express delivery in up to
10 days.
Everyone benefits
The user of the elevator receives benefits such as shorter waiting and travel times as well as significantly improved travel comfort. For the property owner, the advantage is primarily shorter downtime, lower power consumption, lower energy consumption and higher reliability. The elevator company benefits from the shortened assembly times, reliable delivery and support as well as the simple order handling.

The drive handle is delivered with the following parts
Hand transmitter
Shoulder strap for hand transmitter
Receiver with connection cable and connector for HydroElite with magnetic feet
Antenna for receiver
Charger 230 volts
Wall bracket for charger
Wireless driving handle from Hydroware can be used on all our products and provides an easier installation.
The wireless driving handle from Hydroware can be used on all of our products and will simplify the installation process.
Quick Installation with wireless driving handle
If the Hydroware wireless drive handle is used, the elevator can be operated wirelessly from the cabin roof. Use the elevator as a means of transport during installation as soon as the new system is placed in the machine room, filled with oil, and connected to the mains. Assembly run does not require that shaft material or cabin node is connected. Brackets that are required are already pre-assembled from the factory, so no extra wiring is needed before you can ride with the elevator, which facilitates and speeds up the installation.

Success story
6 day delivery
Three weeks before Christmas, Morgan Nilsson, Back Office manager at Hydroware, received a call about a delivery of a HydroElite to the UK. The elevator company needed to have the elevator delivered before the Christmas holidays. Santa has Rudolf pulling the sledge, but at Hydroware there is Jack Rudolf on the case who makes sure that all packages get off correctly. Six days after the order was received, Jack and Morgan waved off the elevator for final delivery.
Many people are surprised that we can produce, factory test and deliver our elevators in such a short time. We have hard-to-beat delivery times that we keep all year round. There are no exceptions during Christmas, but it is extra fun to be able to deliver packages for Christmas.
Morgan Nilsson, Back Office Manager
With
5 weeks standard delivery and 10 days express production
, Hydroware’s partners can order their elevators into December and still have their packages delivered before Christmas. There is no Christmas miracle behind the fast deliveries, but it is business as usual at Hydroware.

VENI
Unique technology with unique servo valve
HydroElite VENI
is an integrated drive and control system for hydraulic elevators. It is equipped with Hydroware’s unique valve system which makes it possible for the elevator to go with direct to floor travel, completely without creeping. The valve also does not need to bypass the oil at full speed upwards. It reduces travel time and energy consumption.
HydroElite VENI is available in both H2 and V5 models. H2 is the latest and most innovative lift control system, and it is designed for both the HydroElite H2 and TractionElite H2. With H2, you get one supplier for all your projects, simple installation and a future proof product thanks to our IoT capabilities.

Benefits with H2

Benefits with every HydroElite VENI (H2 and V5)
Low energy consumption
HydroElite VENI takes full advantage of the unique valve. The system provides an energy consumption that is up to 50% lower than traditional electronic valves. HydroElite VENI is equipped with a soft starter and a submerged oil motor.
Quick installation
HydroElite VENI is pre-assembled and function tested in our factory, which shortens the installation time. Commissioning is easily done with the help of a learning journey for the hydraulics and one for the floor plan setting. No manual adjustments are required and the valve accuracy increases for each trip.
Increased capacity and comfort
Direct approach to the floor and the fact that no bypass of the oil is needed, gives shorter travel time and increased travel capacity. In addition, the reaction time from a command to start is very short due to the fact that the entire system is perfectly tuned, which also helps to increase the elevator’s capacity and comfort.
No overheated oil
Thanks to the valve’s unique properties, more trips can be made without the oil getting too hot. With a HydroElite VENI, you can often eliminate the risk of overheated oil and the use of energy-intensive oil coolers.
Everything from one supplier
The fact that the drive and control system come from the same supplier provides increased security and easier handling in terms of support, service and guarantees throughout the lifespan of the elevator.

Elevator Modernization - repair or renovate an elevator
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Modernization of elevators
Modernization, or elevator renovation, means that the elevator is upgraded by replacing parts such as drive system, electronics, and other wear parts. The elevator frame and other robust parts, which can live for several generations, can be preserved and become part of the upgraded elevator. A modernized elevator always meets today’s safety and legal requirements, gets superior travel comfort, becomes energy efficient and accessible.
Therefore, you should modernise
The cost of an elevator installation is halved by renovating the elevator instead of discarding the whole and installing a new one. It is not just the purchase and installation costs that are reduced by choosing to renovate and modernize. The time that the elevator needs to stand still decreases from up to five weeks down to between one to two weeks. At the same time, the opportunity to modernize again in the future is retained.
When an elevator starts to age, you should modernise it instead of replacing it. That will save money, time and lower the environmental impact.
Lower cost
A complete replacement of the elevator often binds the system to a single supplier, which increases the cost of repairs and spare parts if the elevator becomes broken. The elevator owner also finds it difficult to expose service of a newly installed elevator to competition. With elevator modernization from us, the owner is not tied to one supplier. An elevator modernization results in lower costs and there is the possibility of modernizing again and again. This means that if the property stands for 100 years, the original elevator can work for the same length of time.
Modernization instead of full replacement:
Cost
About 50% lower total cost over the lifespan of the elevator
Significantly lower service and repair costs
Open systems provide flexibility in choosing suppliers in the future
Time
It is faster to modernize than to replace the entire elevator
The downtime is reduced by several weeks
Shorter delivery times
Sustainable elevators
Half environmental impact
The circular option
Robust components with a long service life
Therefore, you should modernize with Hydroware
We deliver products to various elevator modernizations all over the world. Since the start in 1998, we have had steady growth and we have developed a large network of service partners. From the beginning, we have worked with a circular mindset and are still the driving force in the industry. We always put quality and the environment first and are certified according to
ISO 9001
and
ISO 14001.
To provide a flexible elevator ownership, our solutions are based on an open and modular system that is well adapted for further modernizations. We can also offer a worry-free elevator ownership in combination with various financing solutions.

HydroElite MRL
is the machine roomless option. Due to several different aspects, it is better to place control and drive systems outside the shaft. The only thing needed for a HydroElite MRL cabinet is 0.3-0.9 square meters, somewhere in the building where the elevator is located. The cabinet does not have to be directly adjacent to the elevator shaft.
HydroElite MRL
is available in
VENI
and
VIDI
versions.

Buy a new elevator - we help you with installation of new elevators
Close
The HydroElite Experience
New elevator
In building that do not have an elevator, during new construction or when adding an existing floor, a new elevator may be relevant. This may, for example, apply to a building with condominiums where an elevator needs to be installed in an existing stairwell or in an industrial property where a need for an elevator has arisen. Sometimes the original purpose of the elevator may have changed over time. In all these cases, it is relevant to buy and install a completely new elevator.
Complete new elevator
from Hydroware
If it’s time to buy a new elevator, there are several reasons to choose a hydraulic elevator from Hydroware. We offer tailor-made and flexible solutions that fit everything from villas to heavy cargo lifts.
Our assortment of elevators provide
space-efficient
,
quiet
and
flexible
solutions
based on our in-house developed design and impressive capacity. With our heritage and prominent market position we offer the best solutions for hydraulic elevators when a hydraulic elevator is applicable, for example
heavy-duty
elevators, properties with up to
6-7 floors
as well as
existing properties
where the need for an elevator has arisen. Hydroware also offer modern and effective solutions for traction elevators. We deliver all parts for new elevators to ensure that the buyer only needs to have contact with one supplier.
When installing a new elevator from Hydroware, the elevator owner gets choice and
flexibility
. Hydroware’s elevators are based on an
open and modular system
, unlike many other major elevator manufacturers. The open system allows components to be replaced to extend the life of the elevator and keep down the price of lift maintenance. Fully functioning parts and the elevator frame
never need to be replaced
. In this way, the owner of the elevator is not forced to buy a completely new elevator again after 20-25 years.
Everything from one supplier
Hydroware delivers all parts to the elevator. The advantage of buying all the components for the elevator from one and the same supplier is that it will be easier to handle service, spare parts, administration, guarantees and any potential complaints.
Quick elevator installation
A new elevator from us can
be installed quickly
. In many cases, residents need to move out of the property while a new elevator is being installed. To keep installation time down, all Hydroware lifts are
pre-assembled,
and
function
tested. The construction of the elevator in combination with the fact that it is pre-tested in our factory means that the elevator can be quickly installed and put into use.
Building with an existing elevator: Modernize
If there is already an elevator in the property,
modernization
is always the best option. The price of the elevator installation usually decreases by over
50%
compared to buying a brand-new elevator. With modernization, the downtime for the elevator is shortened by several weeks. Read more about
modernizing elevators here

An elevator should have the same lifespan as the property

Sustainable elevators - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Elevators
do not have to be worn and thrown away
An elevator should have the same lifespan as the property. This means that an older elevator should not be replaced after several years – it should be modernized. The environmental impact of an elevator is usually greater during manufacturing than during operation. Therefore, it is important that the elevator is adapted to circular economy to enable more modernizations during its lifetime. In this way,
we leave wear and tear
mentality and save on the earth’s resources.
For over 25 years, Hydroware has worked to move the elevator industry towards a
circular ecosystem
by preserving the elevator’s material and economic values over a very long period of use. Future-oriented products together with circular business models are a prerequisite for taking further steps towards a
sustainable world
.
Modular elevators
Over the past 25 years, many manufacturers in the elevator industry have chosen to design elevators that are less modular than before. This means that they are no longer as suitable for modernization.
For environmental reasons, it is obvious that we must go back to installing elevators that are adapted to be modernized, module by module. Modernizing an older elevator instead of replacing it entirely with a new one means halving the environmental impact.
Consume less material
In a
modernization
, parts such as car frame, cabin and guides are retained, which often last for several generations. On the other hand, drive and control systems are being replaced and a new interior and perhaps new doors are being installed. The elevator will be like new and last at least as long as a brand-new elevator without the operating costs being higher.
Our products for elevator modernization
Hydroware’s
drive and control systems
are well suited for modernization thanks to their robust and modular design. Replacing an old elevator with a Hydroware solution can give up to 70 % reduction in both energy consumption and power demand.

Hydroware –
a circular actor
Hydroware are
members of CirEko
, Sweden’s broadest member and business network for circular business. We are members of CirEko to be involved and support the work of influencing society and various industries to move towards circular thinking and circular business models.
Since our business model is already based on product life extension, we are presented as a
circular forerunner at Circular Sweden.
Lifecycle for elevators
We have had a life cycle analysis done for a 4-person elevator in a residential building. It clearly shows that the material used to manufacture the lift has a significantly greater negative impact on the environment than that from operation it during the property’s lifetime.
Circular economy for elevators
Circular economy is an expression of economic models in a company, society, or organisation, which highlights business opportunities where circular cycles are used rather than linear processes that have been dominant for a long period of time.

Elevator service at low costs | Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Elevator service
Hydroware has a large partner network of companies that provide elevator service. We have an established collaboration with our partner companies where we assist with field technicians and support. With over 25 years of expertise and together with our service partners, we have carried out various elevator modernizations all over the world.
Elevator service at a low cost
Hydroware is working to reduce the cost of elevator service. This is one of the reasons why our products are designed to contain as few moving mechanical parts as possible. To facilitate service and modernization of elevators, we build our products on open and modular systems. The modularity means that individual components can be easily replaced, which can prevent a complete replacement of the elevator after 25 years of use. With our products, elevator owners are not locked into a supplier or a service company and this means that the price for elevator service can be kept down.
If support or elevator service is needed, you are welcome to contact us for guidance.

Whistleblowing policy - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Whistleblowing policy at Hydroware
Why a whistleblowing policy?
With this whistleblower policy, we set out procedures and safeguards in situations where serious misconduct within our organization is reported and there is a public interest in this being made public. The policy has been developed with consideration of the Directive from EU and the Swedish law, “Lag (2021:890) om skydd för personer som rapporterar om missförhållanden”.
Our starting point
We cherish a corporate culture characterized by openness and dialogue. When problems arise, we hope for conversations, preferably at an early stage. Even if there is no misconduct of such a nature as to cause an alarm in accordance with this policy, we always encourage an open conversation directly with your manager or the CEO.
Who can blow the whistle?
A person who in a work-related context has learned of or obtained information regarding misconduct has the right to report this. This can be for an example: Employees, volunteers, interns, shareholders, consultants and suppliers.
Ways to blow the whistle.
At Hydroware there are the opportunity to blow the whistle both verbally and in writing by:
Send an email to:
hr@hydroware.se
By mail to: Hydroware, att. Annie Alm, Box 66, 34221 Alvesta, Sweden
By calling HR, Annie Alm: +46 472 45 177
Response
As soon as somebody blow the whistle, the whistleblower must receive a confirmation that the whistleblowing has been received. Immediately after, there will be an orderly investigation/analysis of the information received.
To the extent that it can be considered appropriate, we regularly give feedback to the whistleblower about how the case is handled.
Questions?
Do you have questions about whistleblowing and our policy? Please contact Annie Alm at HR to get your answers.

Hydroware Italy to focus on NEW LIFTS – new reseller for MOD in Italy
21 July, 2023
In the 10
th
year anniversary of Hydroware Srl, the company has signed a new reseller agreement with CSH.
Hydroware has been present on the Italian market through a subsidiary for 10 years. The decade long venture has developed thanks to professional customers that have been able to capitalize on the strengths of Hydroware’s unique products. Hydroware’s products and offering has proved to be appreciated for complex projects in the Italian market.
Over the past 10 years, most projects have been dominated by specialised hydraulic lift modernisations, demanding either very high capacity, high speeds, high travel heights or heavy loads, and often intended for public use like airports, railway stations, metro stations, hospitals, or shopping malls. Even though modernisations have been the main driver, the interest for complete lift packages has increased drastically over the years.
Rising
interest in Hydroware’s complete lift packages
After 10 years of active presence and experience in the Italian market, with the increasing demand for Hydroware’s complete lift offering both locally and globally, the market demand for quality consulting support and after-sales support has increased considerably. Hydroware is experiencing all-time high demand in the segment of complete lifts.
In order to improve internal processes and meeting domestic and international market demands, Hydroware Srl is focusing efforts and resources on the complete lift offering. As of July 2023, Hydroware Srl will be at your disposal
exclusively
for the supply of complete lift packages. However, Hydroware will not be leaving the Italian modernisation market.
Exclusive partner for MOD in Italy: CSH – Consultancy and technical Support for Hydraulic lifts
Hydroware is very pleased to announce that we have signed an exclusive reseller agreement with our partner CSH for all consulting support, product sales, supply of spare parts and after sales support regarding our products HydroElite and TractionElite for modernisation of existing lifts on the Italian market. We therefore invite you to address all future Italian requests and orders for modernisation and requests for spare parts and after sales technical support directly to our partner:

Elite
VENI
Unique technology with unique servo valve
HydroElite VENI
is an integrated drive and control system for hydraulic elevators. It is equipped with Hydroware’s unique valve system which makes it possible for the elevator to go with direct to floor travel, completely without creeping. The valve also does not need to bypass the oil at full speed upwards. It reduces travel time and energy consumption.
HydroElite VENI is available in both H2 and V5 models. H2 is the latest and most innovative lift control system, and it is designed for both the HydroElite H2 and TractionElite H2. With H2, you get one supplier for all your projects, simple installation and a future proof product thanks to our IoT capabilities.

Benefits with every HydroElite VENI (H2 and V5)
Low energy consumption
HydroElite VENI takes full advantage of the unique valve. The system provides an energy consumption that is up to 50% lower than traditional electronic valves. HydroElite VENI is equipped with a soft starter and a submerged oil motor.
Quick installation
HydroElite VENI is pre-assembled and function tested in our factory, which shortens the installation time. Commissioning is easily done with the help of a learning journey for the hydraulics and one for the floor plan setting. No manual adjustments are required and the valve accuracy increases for each trip.
Increased capacity and comfort
Direct approach to the floor and the fact that no bypass of the oil is needed, gives shorter travel time and increased travel capacity. In addition, the reaction time from a command to start is very short due to the fact that the entire system is perfectly tuned, which also helps to increase the elevator’s capacity and comfort.
No overheated oil
Thanks to the valve’s unique properties, more trips can be made without the oil getting too hot. With a HydroElite VENI, you can often eliminate the risk of overheated oil and the use of energy-intensive oil coolers.
Everything from one supplier
The fact that the drive and control system come from the same supplier provides increased security and easier handling in terms of support, service and guarantees throughout the lifespan of the elevator.

The HydroElite Experience
An elevator should be your security
. As a property owner, you should feel calm knowing that the elevator works and that it will continue to work in the future. On the day something needs to be fixed, you should not be surprised by expensive service costs. A hydraulic elevator from Hydroware is an economically sustainable solution that gives you flexibility.
If the property does not have an elevator, you can install an elevator and thus allow more people to stay longer in their apartments. It is also possible to build an additional floor and install an elevator.
Read more about the possibility of an extension floor here
.
We know modernization
Hydroware, together with our service partners, has carried out many modernizations of hydraulic elevators all over the world. We have solutions for modernization and new installation of elevators and collaborate with both smaller property owners and large international companies. Long experience and a large network of service partners means that you can feel safe in your choice of elevator.
Lower cost
Whether you want to install a new elevator or want to modernize your existing elevator, you can reduce the cost of ownership with our solutions. We deliver an open and modular system, which means that you do not commit to a supplier but can instead keep costs for service and repair down. We also offer financing solutions to give you a worry-free elevator ownership.
M
odernize again and again
After a modernization, the elevator can normally be used for another 25-30 years. Then it is possible to modernize it again. A completely new price-pressed elevator with a leaner frame normally does not last as long, which leads to expensive and extensive repairs in the long run. In addition, a completely new elevator rarely has the possibility to be modernized at all, which means that it will be time for another full replacement after 20-25 years.
Sustainable option
If you have an elevator in the building, you should always modernize and reuse robust and functional parts instead of installing a new elevator. With an elevator modernization from Hydroware, you give the property a more sustainable profile and the environmental impact is about half compared to installing a new elevator. This applies, for example, to elevators in residential buildings with up to 6-7 floors and shopping centers with 4-5 floors and up to 250,000 journeys per year. With our elevators, you can reduce your energy consumption by up to 70% compared to traditional hydraulic elevators. In addition, power consumption can be reduced by up to two-thirds, which results in lower subscription fees – which often make up the major part of an elevators operating costs.

As a partner of Hydroware, you take part in a partnership where we do everything to deliver a high level of service and support. We call this The HydroElite Experience. Watch the film about The HydroElite Experience below.
Success story: From a property owner’s perspective
Modernizing the elevators was a success
“The repair costs of our old elevators skyrocketed and it was often difficult to get spare parts. Then we decided to modernize the elevators because it was cheaper and more environmentally friendly.
We kept guides and elevator cabin but replaced drive and control systems, doors and panels “, says Gösta Fridh, vice chairman of the tenant-owner association Ruuth 50 in Helsingborg.
“It has become bright, fresh, more less abled body-friendly and we save around SEK 35,000 per year in reduced energy and power costs. Now the elevators run flawlessly and the residents think it is a success “, says a satisfied Inger Tunström, chairman.

Circular economy for elevators - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Circular economy for elevators
Circular economy is an expression of economic models in a company, society, or organisation, which highlights business opportunities where circular cycles are used rather than linear processes that have been dominant up until now.
An elevator consists of several components with very varying service life. The elevator is normally installed in a very protected environment so the impact from the surroundings is negligible. Components that are not wear and tear parts have a very long service life, such as guides, support frame, elevator car and door panels.
Reuse as much as possible
Build robust modular elevators that can be repaired. When, after 20-30 years, it is time to modernise the elevator, reuse as much as possible. Finally, when all parts are worn out, it’s time to recycle all the material and replace with a brand new one.
Modernize
Hydroware’s elevators are adapted to be modernized again and again. There are many reasons to upgrade the elevator instead of replacing the entire elevator. Read more about all the benefits of
elevator
modernization here
.
Document
Read more on sustainable elevators in our brochure.
Lifecycle for lifts
We have had a life cycle analysis done for a 4-person elevator in a residential building. It clearly shows that the material used to manufacture the lift has a significantly greater negative impact on the environment than that from operation during the property’s lifetime.
Sustainable lifts
For us to move into a sustainable world, we need to go back to installing lifts that are suited for modernisation, where they can be updated module by module. A modernised lift will have half the environmental impact of a completely replaced lift.

The HydroElite Experience
Re-Energising the industry at interlift 2023
16 August, 2023
Unveiling One – Regenerative Inverter Drive – for All
As the lift industry gears up for the highly anticipated interlift 2023, one company is poised to Re-Energise the field. We are set to unveil a new breakthrough, introducing regenerative energy solutions for both traction and hydraulic lift modernisations.
TractionElite ECO and HydroElite VICI
The introduction of the TractionElite ECO and HydroElite VICI models mark a significant milestone for Hydroware as both models will be equipped with Hydroware’s own inverter drive. The TractionElite ECO, designed for traction lift systems, boasts exceptional energy-saving capabilities, reducing operating costs. Meanwhile, the HydroElite VICI pushes the boundaries of innovation by harnessing regenerative energy from hydraulic lift operations. The regenerative inverter drive coupled with IoT-solutions, will enable lifts to become an integrated part in smart building infrastructure and participate in energy sourcing.
Showing unparalleled outcomes
In preparation for interlift, Hydroware has conducted extensive tests to showcase the capabilities of the regenerative inverter drive. The results have been nothing short of impressive. During rigorous testing, the VICI model operated continuously for an entire day, demonstrating unparalleled outcomes. As expected, the increase in oil temperature remained minimal, leading Hydroware’s experts to predict a future where the need for oil coolers in hydraulic lifts will become obsolete.
With the eagerly awaited unveiling of the cutting-edge innovations, the prospect of re-energising the lift industry is no longer a distant dream but an imminent reality. By harnessing the power of regenerative energy in an inverter drive for both traction and hydraulic lifts, Hydroware is leading the charge towards a more sustainable future in lift technology.
Join us 17-20 October in Augsburg
We would be thrilled to show you our new innovations at interlift 2023. This year we will be located in
Hall 3
and we are set to really make a bang. Interested in a ticket? Contact your local Hydroware representative or send an e-mail to

Add a new floor - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Older people can stay in their apartments
The age group from 65 years and up is going to increase in the coming years. Thanks to an elevator, many people in this category can stay in their apartment, saving a lot of money each year.
Young people will also be able to afford it
No new plots of land or infrastructure are required for apartments built on an existing house. This means lower housing costs compared to completely newly produced housing. A prerequisite for many young people to be able to afford their first home.
State and municipality benefit greatly from it
There is a big difference in the cost to society between home care and especially housing for the elderly. Older people who stay in their apartments are not only a good deal for society but also usually what the elderly themselves want.
No new land or infrastructure required
When building on one floor, no new plots of land need to be set aside and infrastructure such as roads, car parks, childcare, schools, health centers, pharmacies, shops, and bus lanes are usually already in place.
Our advice for getting property owners to invest
Introduce an investment grant for elevators that covers half the cost of materials and installation for this type of property. A win for all of us.

Two projects with apartment buildings without an elevator where new stairwells have been built and an elevator
has been installed in the old stairwells
Extended stairwells
Skarpan in Linköping
– Sweden
Skarpan is a residential area from the 1960s with 283 apartments in 15 three-storey buildings without an elevator. The houses were modernized in 2015-2018 with new stairwells being built and elevators installed in the old stairwells. A 4th floor with apartments was also built.
The tenants were very satisfied with the increased accessibility for everyone thanks to the new elevators.
Hydroware has delivered the elevators that were installed by Nordisk Hiss.

.
A fourth floor
Lilla Vallgatan, Skänninge
The housing company in Mjölby has renovated three residential properties in Skänninge on Lilla Vallgatan. Two of the houses have new glazed stairwells and balconies and an elevator installed in the old stairwells. One of the homes has also been converted into safe housing. The third home has a new glazed stairwell and a glazed entrance and elevator installed in one of the stairwells.
Through the installation of an elevator, you have got properties with higher accessibility, which means that the elderly can stay longer and you have got fresh properties that provide higher income.

Architect - Flexible elevator solutions | Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Flexible elevator
s
Create attractive and durable elevators with a tailor-made solution through Hydroware. With a hydraulic elevator, we can adapt and tailor the elevator to suit your wishes. The hydraulic elevator is a space-efficient solution that takes up less of the property’s area and there are all possibilities for an aesthetically pleasing design. Create the elevator solution you want.
Tailor-made elevator
Passenger elevators are elevators that are intended for passenger transport. These elevators are common in, among other things, apartment buildings, tenant-owner associations, offices and public environments. We offer flexible solutions where we tailor the elevator to your wishes. Hydroware’s solutions are space-efficient and take up less of the property’s space. In this way, our solutions maximize the space in the property that can be used for other purposes. Shape, color, material and shaft dimensions can be adapted completely as needed. We have solutions for
narrow shafts that fit in tight spaces
, minimal elevator pit, low top height and for
machine roomless elevator
, which means that the elevator can get the expression that is sought.
The hydraulic elevator is the architect’s friend
A hydraulic elevator from Hydroware is an energy-efficient elevator with a low environmental impact. The climate impact of a modernized elevator is significantly lower than the alternatives. Keep energy consumption down when operating the elevator and reduce the total cost. An elevator from Hydroware can be modernized again and again. In this way, costs are kept down for the entire lifespan of the elevator. Read more about the
life cycle cost of elevator here
.
Neither load weight nor lifting height limits the design. In buildings with up to 6-7 floors, a hydraulic elevator is preferable. The elevator can handle a load weight of up to 3.5 tonnes and the load from the elevator ends up on the ground slab instead of in the building’s vertical construction.

Success story – Flexible elevators
Skansen Kronan
Skansen Kronan is a building with high cultural values and one of Gothenburg’s foremost landmarks. Now more people can access the fortress through a specially adapted elevator solution from Hydroware.
The product from Hydroware was chosen by our procured contractor Tvåtumfyra to meet the very special requirements of the project, mainly that we could not solve space neither at the bottom nor at the top in the normal way. The result has been very good and we are happy that a high finish was offered so that we create a dignified and accessible new entrance to the building. Hydroware and Vinga were solution-oriented and the few deviations that appeared were handled with good special solutions in collaboration with the builder.
Dan Andersson, technical manager at the National Property Board (Sweden)
The project was carried out together with Vinga Elevator from Gothenburg.

The HydroElite Experience
HydroElite MINI – for small spaces
HydroElite MINI
is a space-efficient variant of HydroElite VENI for when there is not enough space on the way to or inside the motor room, to be able to use a standard tank size. The tank volume is 90 liters, and the control cabinet is delivered separately. HydroElite MINI has a capacity that can normally handle a 630 kg elevator up to 6 levels.
Order a HydroElite MINI
Advantages of HydroElite MINI
Tailored for small spaces
HydroElite MINI is the tailor-made alternative for small motor rooms. The control cabinet is located separately to enable wall mounting.
Low energy consumption
HydroElite MINI takes full advantage of the unique valve. The system provides an energy consumption that is up to 50% lower than traditional electronic valves. HydroElite MINI is equipped with a soft starter and an oil-cooled motor.
Quick installation
HydroElite MINI is pre-assembled and function tested in our factory, which shortens the installation time. Commissioning is easily done with the help of a learning journey for the hydraulics and one for the floor plan setting. No manual adjustments are required and the valve accuracy increases for each trip.
Increased capacity and comfort
Direct approach to the floor and the fact that no bypass of the oil is needed gives shorter travel time and increased travel capacity. In addition, the reaction time from a command to start is very short due to the fact that the entire system is perfectly tuned, which also helps to increase the elevator’s capacity and comfort.
No overheated oil
Thanks to the valve’s unique properties, more trips can be made without the oil getting too hot. With a HydroElite MINI, you can often eliminate the risk of overheated oil and the use of energy-intensive oil coolers.
One supplier
The fact that the drive and control system come from the same supplier provides increased security and easier handling in terms of support, service and guarantees throughout the lifespan of the elevator.

The HydroElite Experience
Elevator consultant
We help you when planning projects
As an elevator consultant, you are an important partner to Hydroware. Here you can find relevant and updated information to facilitate the preparation of your project.
With Hydroware’s products, the elevator’s environmental impact can be reduced over the elevator’s service life and unnecessary replacements of robust parts can be avoided. More specific information for project preparation can be found below.
Modernization
If there is already an elevator, it should always be modernized instead of being replaced. With modernization from Hydroware, the lifespan of the elevator is extended, and the environmental impact is reduced by 50% compared with a complete replacement. Furthermore, power consumption and energy consumption can be reduced by up to 70% while the elevator gets superior travel comfort and increased capacity.
Read more about modernization here.
New installation
Hydraulic elevators are the best choice in buildings up to 6-7 floors and for shopping centers up to 4-5 floors with up to 250,000 trips per year. With our hydraulic elevators , the surface of the building can be used in an efficient way. For new installations, we provide floor views and a review of existing documents to agree on the best solution.

With
AMA
(General Materials and Job Description), ideas and visions are translated into quality-assured construction. The tool helps you ensure the quality of the construction process – from the first request documentation to the final inspection.
Hydroware advocates that AMA EL be used as much as possible. The choices available in AMA EL are not always enough to ensure that the delivery is what you expect. Then the technical function description in the requirements specification should be expanded with additional requirements to ensure what is actually offered and subsequently delivered. Hydroware has developed suggestions on how to specify functions of our products in a clear way.
Suggested technical function description
HydroElite VENI
71.BC/11
System with electronic valves – direct drive to floor

Success story: From the perspective of an elevator consultant
To seek the best solution for each elevator project
“I was first tipped off about Hydroware by a contractor,” says Robin Primrose, an elevator consultant in Scotland. “It was a few years ago and now I have my own experience from a lot of installations.”
Impartial assessment
“For me as a consultant, it is important to make an impartial assessment for the customer in order to maintain credibility and so that the customer gets the best solution. That means I look at the total cost of installing and operating the elevator.”
Easy to install
“So far, I have only received positive comments from my clients about Hydroware’s system. They think it is easy to install, deliveries arrive on time and the system works immediately when you start it up. That my customer is satisfied with the product is absolutely crucial for me. ”
Advantage of modernizations
During the last years, 50% of the hydraulic systems I have proposed to the customer have come from Hydroware and that number will certainly increase in the future. Especially considering the advantage of carrying out renovations with Hydroware’s system without having to throw out the working parts of the old elevator.”

Elevator service at low costs | Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Elevator service
Hydroware has a large partner network of companies that provide elevator service. We have an established collaboration with our partner companies where we assist with field technicians and support. With over 25 years of expertise and together with our service partners, we have carried out various elevator modernizations all over the world.
Elevator service at a low cost
Hydroware is working to reduce the cost of elevator service. This is one of the reasons why our products are designed to contain as few moving mechanical parts as possible. To facilitate service and modernization of elevators, we build our products on open and modular systems. The modularity means that individual components can be easily replaced, which can prevent a complete replacement of the elevator after 25 years of use. With our products, elevator owners are not locked into a supplier or a service company and this means that the price for elevator service can be kept down.
If support or elevator service is needed, you are welcome to contact us for guidance.
Hydroware Support
Contact our support team for fast, flexible and personal help with installation and operation of our products.
Our field technicians can help with on-site service. We have applications for troubleshooting, documentation, parameter adjustments etc.

Success story
6 day delivery
Three weeks before Christmas, Morgan Nilsson, Back Office manager at Hydroware, received a call about a delivery of a HydroElite to the UK. The elevator company needed to have the elevator delivered before the Christmas holidays. Santa has Rudolf pulling the sledge, but at Hydroware there is Jack Rudolf on the case who makes sure that all packages get off correctly. Six days after the order was received, Jack and Morgan waved off the elevator for final delivery.
Many people are surprised that we can produce, factory test and deliver our elevators in such a short time. We have hard-to-beat delivery times that we keep all year round. There are no exceptions during Christmas, but it is extra fun to be able to deliver packages for Christmas.
Morgan Nilsson, Back Office Manager
With
5 weeks standard delivery and 10 days express production
, Hydroware’s partners can order their elevators into December and still have their packages delivered before Christmas. There is no Christmas miracle behind the fast deliveries, but it is business as usual at Hydroware.

PSU H2 DILIGENS
A safe absolute positioning system with UCM and overspeed tripping functions. Activates electrical safety gears and replaces all safety-relevant limit switches and floor sensors.
SIL3 compliant and certified according to EN81-20/50 PESSRAL.
Decentralized user interface
With TractionElite H2 MRLs decentralised user interface, the aesthetic impact will be held to a minimum after a modernisation. The decentralised control box, housing the 10-inch touch display and user interface, is placed on a wall outside of the shaft and measures approximately 30×50 cm. The larger control box, including the frequency converter, is placed inside the shaft.
10-inch touch display and accessibility
The control unit is fitted with a 10-inch high resolution touch display. Among other features, the user will be able to find documentation, schematics, historical data and error logs directly in the display. Furthermore, there are instruction movies and language options available. The lift controller is accessible from any smart device and enables the user to connect to the controller from anywhere in the lift shaft.
Surveillance, access and updates with cloud connection
All units come with HydroCloud readiness. Thanks to the HydroCloud connection, the unit can be accessed from anywhere. The unit can be updated remotely, allowing documentation to be up to date to the latest version. The system is open and can be adapted to work with other monitoring systems on the market.
Pit and car node
Our new innovative pit node is installed in the shaft pit and is designed to cut down the amount of wires that run from the lift shaft to the motor room. Similarly, the updated car node is smaller and better prepared for a quick and neat installation. Due to even more wires being pre-wired with plugs, the on-site wiring is very fast and basically Plug and Play.
Models of TractionElite and HydroElite drive and control systems
TractionElite is available in MR and MRL configurations.
HydroElite is available as H2 and V5 – VENI, VIDI, MINI and MRL.
HydroElite MINI
For small spaces
HydroElite MINI is used where there is not enough space.
Good when there is too little space on the way to or inside the machine room, to be able to use a normal tank size.

Elite
Unik teknologi med patenterad ventil
Alla HydroEliter är utrustade med en servoventil som gör det möjligt för hissen att gå med direktinkörning till plan, helt utan krypkörning.
Ventilen gör dessutom att ingen bypass av oljan vid full hastighet uppåt erfordras. Det minskar restiden och energiförbrukningen drastiskt jämfört med traditionella elektroniska ventiler.

är Hydrowares två produktserier som båda är designade för att göra modernisering av hissar så enkelt som möjligt. Att välja en av Hydrowares produkter ger både dig som hissföretag och hissägare, mängder av fördelar.
Olika modeller av Hydrowares driv- och styrsystem
TractionElite samt HydroElite
HydroElite finns i versionerna VENI, VIDI, MINI och MRL.
One for All
Med Hydroware får du en leverantör och en styrning till samtliga dina projekt. Vårt styrsystem H2 är ONE FOR ALL då det är designat för både vår TractionElite H2 och vår HydroElite H2.

ONE FOR ALL
Snabb och enkel installation
Manuell körning efter någon timmes installationsarbete är möjligt beroende på ditt val av driv- och styrsystem. Alla våra produkter kommer förmonterade och funktionstestade från våra fabriker i Alvesta och Södertälje. Dessutom är kablagen förkopplade. Allt detta i kombination med den enkla driftsättningen möjliggör upp mot en
halvering av installationstiden
jämfört med traditionella system.
Förtestat på fabrik
Alla HydroElite och TractionElite förtestas på fysiska hissar våra svenska fabriker till 100% innan leverans. Det minskar risken för eventuella problem på byggplatsen samtidigt som installationstiden reduceras kraftigt. Vidare säkerställs den totala funktionen och att Hydroware kan ta ansvar för hela produkten och en säker stabil funktion under hela hissens livslängd.
Ökad kapacitet och komfort
Redan i design- och konstruktionsstadiet samtrimmas HydroElitens driv- och styrsystem med varandra. Detta bidrar till en kort reaktionstid från kommando till start vilket tillsammans med den unika ventilens egenskaper ökar
hissens kapacitet och komfort
.
Självlärande
Driftsättningen görs enkelt med hjälp av en läroresa för hydrauliken och en för stannplansinställningen. Systemet är helt och hållet
självlärande och självjusterande
. Inga manuella förändringar krävs och ventilens exakthet och precision vid inkörning till plan ökar för varje resa.
Leveranstid
Vi vill hålla marknadens bästa leveranstider. Vi arbetar ständigt för att pressa ner tiden från order till att vår produkt lämnar fabriken. Vår standardleveranstid på HydroElite ligger på
4-5 veckor
och för TractionElite ytterligare någon vecka. Med
expressleverans
på en HydroElite kan vi leverera från fabrik på mindre än
10 dagar
.
Alla får fördelar
Användaren av hissen får fördelar som kortare vänte- och restider samt väsentligt förbättrad reskomfort. För fastighetsägaren är fördelen framförallt kortare stilleståndstider, lägre effektuttag, lägre energiförbrukning och högre tillförlitlighet. Hissföretaget tjänar på de förkortade montagetiderna, tillförlitlig leverans och support samt den enkla orderhanteringen.

Add a new floor - Hydroware

The HydroElite Experience
Older people can stay in their apartments
The age group from 65 years and up is going to increase in the coming years. Thanks to an elevator, many people in this category can stay in their apartment, saving a lot of money each year.
Young people will also be able to afford it
No new plots of land or infrastructure are required for apartments built on an existing house. This means lower housing costs compared to completely newly produced housing. A prerequisite for many young people to be able to afford their first home.
State and municipality benefit greatly from it
There is a big difference in the cost to society between home care and especially housing for the elderly. Older people who stay in their apartments are not only a good deal for society but also usually what the elderly themselves want.
No new land or infrastructure required
When building on one floor, no new plots of land need to be set aside and infrastructure such as roads, car parks, childcare, schools, health centers, pharmacies, shops, and bus lanes are usually already in place.
Our advice for getting property owners to invest
Introduce an investment grant for elevators that covers half the cost of materials and installation for this type of property. A win for all of us.

Two projects with apartment buildings without an elevator where new stairwells have been built and an elevator
has been installed in the old stairwells
Extended stairwells
Skarpan in Linköping
– Sweden
Skarpan is a residential area from the 1960s with 283 apartments in 15 three-storey buildings without an elevator. The houses were modernized in 2015-2018 with new stairwells being built and elevators installed in the old stairwells. A 4th floor with apartments was also built.
The tenants were very satisfied with the increased accessibility for everyone thanks to the new elevators.
Hydroware has delivered the elevators that were installed by Nordisk Hiss.
Facade with extended stairwells and glazed balconies.
See more images from the project here
.
A fourth floor
Lilla Vallgatan, Skänninge
The housing company in Mjölby has renovated three residential properties in Skänninge on Lilla Vallgatan. Two of the houses have new glazed stairwells and balconies and an elevator installed in the old stairwells. One of the homes has also been converted into safe housing. The third home has a new glazed stairwell and a glazed entrance and elevator installed in one of the stairwells.
Through the installation of an elevator, you have got properties with higher accessibility, which means that the elderly can stay longer and you have got fresh properties that provide higher income.
Facade with extended stairwells and a fourth floor.

Lifecycle for elevators - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Lifecycle for elevators
We have had a life cycle analysis done for a 4-storey elevator in a residential building. It clearly shows that the material used to manufacture the elevator has a significantly greater negative impact on the environment than that from the operation of the elevator during the life of the property.
In this example, both elevators are installed in a new residential building in Berlin. The hydraulic elevator is then modernized every 20 years and the elevator with counterweight is replaced completely at the same interval.
Environmental impact from the material
For most people in the elevator industry, the results are surprising. Until now, all focus has been on reducing energy consumption in operation and much has been improved here. But now it’s time to also look at the environmental impact of the material used.
Elevator without counterweight in lower buildings
Our life cycle analysis clearly shows that it is most appropriate to have an elevator without a counterweight for lower buildings, such as residential buildings.
37,000 kg less carbon dioxide emissions
We estimate the lifespan of a residential building at 80 years and the lifespan of the elevator at 20 years. The environmental impact of a counterweight elevator will then be 37,000 kg more carbon dioxide emissions compared to a hydraulic elevator. The amount of carbon dioxide emissions is equivalent to driving a petrol-powered car that meets the EURO 5 emission requirement of 11 500 km,

Read more about circular economy and modernization of elevators through the links below.
Circular economy for elevators
Circular economy is an expression for economical models in a company, society or an organisation, which highlights business opportunities where circular ecosystems are used, rather than linear processes – that have dominated the business climate thus far.
Modernization
Modernization, or renovation of an elevator, means that the elevator is upgraded through the replacement of parts like drive unit, electronics and other wear and tear parts.

In this example, both elevators are installed in a new residential building in Berlin. The hydraulic elevator is then modernized every 20 years and the elevator with counterweight is replaced completely at the same interval.
Environmental impact from the material
For most people in the elevator industry, the results are surprising. Until now, all focus has been on reducing energy consumption in operation and much has been improved here. But now it’s time to also look at the environmental impact of the material used.
Elevator without counterweight in lower buildings
Our life cycle analysis clearly shows that it is most appropriate to have an elevator without a counterweight for lower buildings, such as residential buildings.
37,000 kg less carbon dioxide emissions
We estimate the lifespan of a residential building at 80 years and the lifespan of the elevator at 20 years. The environmental impact of a counterweight elevator will then be 37,000 kg more carbon dioxide emissions compared to a hydraulic elevator. The amount of carbon dioxide emissions is equivalent to driving a petrol-powered car that meets the EURO 5 emission requirement of 11 500 km,

Circular economy for elevators
Circular economy is an expression for economical models in a company, society or an organisation, which highlights business opportunities where circular ecosystems are used, rather than linear processes – that have dominated the business climate thus far.
Modernization
Modernization, or renovation of an elevator, means that the elevator is upgraded through the replacement of parts like drive unit, electronics and other wear and tear parts.

Elevator Modernization - repair or renovate an elevator
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Modernization of elevators
Modernization, or elevator renovation, means that the elevator is upgraded by replacing parts such as drive system, electronics, and other wear parts. The elevator frame and other robust parts, which can live for several generations, can be preserved and become part of the upgraded elevator. A modernized elevator always meets today’s safety and legal requirements, gets superior travel comfort, becomes energy efficient and accessible.
Therefore, you should modernise
The cost of an elevator installation is halved by renovating the elevator instead of discarding the whole and installing a new one. It is not just the purchase and installation costs that are reduced by choosing to renovate and modernize. The time that the elevator needs to stand still decreases from up to five weeks down to between one to two weeks. At the same time, the opportunity to modernize again in the future is retained.
When an elevator starts to age, you should modernise it instead of replacing it. That will save money, time and lower the environmental impact.
Lower cost
A complete replacement of the elevator often binds the system to a single supplier, which increases the cost of repairs and spare parts if the elevator becomes broken. The elevator owner also finds it difficult to expose service of a newly installed elevator to competition. With elevator modernization from us, the owner is not tied to one supplier. An elevator modernization results in lower costs and there is the possibility of modernizing again and again. This means that if the property stands for 100 years, the original elevator can work for the same length of time.
Modernization instead of full replacement:
Cost
About 50% lower total cost over the lifespan of the elevator
Significantly lower service and repair costs
Open systems provide flexibility in choosing suppliers in the future
Time
It is faster to modernize than to replace the entire elevator
The downtime is reduced by several weeks
Shorter delivery times
Sustainable elevators
Half environmental impact
The circular option
Robust components with a long service life
Therefore, you should modernize with Hydroware
We deliver products to various elevator modernizations all over the world. Since the start in 1998, we have had steady growth and we have developed a large network of service partners. From the beginning, we have worked with a circular mindset and are still the driving force in the industry. We always put quality and the environment first and are certified according to
ISO 9001
and
ISO 14001.
To provide a flexible elevator ownership, our solutions are based on an open and modular system that is well adapted for further modernizations. We can also offer a worry-free elevator ownership in combination with various financing solutions.

Elevator consultant - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
Elevator consultant
We help you when planning projects
As an elevator consultant, you are an important partner to Hydroware. Here you can find relevant and updated information to facilitate the preparation of your project.
With Hydroware’s products, the elevator’s environmental impact can be reduced over the elevator’s service life and unnecessary replacements of robust parts can be avoided. More specific information for project preparation can be found below.
Modernization
If there is already an elevator, it should always be modernized instead of being replaced. With modernization from Hydroware, the lifespan of the elevator is extended, and the environmental impact is reduced by 50% compared with a complete replacement. Furthermore, power consumption and energy consumption can be reduced by up to 70% while the elevator gets superior travel comfort and increased capacity.
Read more about modernization here.
New installation
Hydraulic elevators are the best choice in buildings up to 6-7 floors and for shopping centers up to 4-5 floors with up to 250,000 trips per year. With our hydraulic elevators , the surface of the building can be used in an efficient way. For new installations, we provide floor views and a review of existing documents to agree on the best solution.

AMA EL
– SWEDEN
With
AMA
(General Materials and Job Description), ideas and visions are translated into quality-assured construction. The tool helps you ensure the quality of the construction process – from the first request documentation to the final inspection.
Hydroware advocates that AMA EL be used as much as possible. The choices available in AMA EL are not always enough to ensure that the delivery is what you expect. Then the technical function description in the requirements specification should be expanded with additional requirements to ensure what is actually offered and subsequently delivered. Hydroware has developed suggestions on how to specify functions of our products in a clear way.
Suggested technical function description
HydroElite VENI
71.BC/11
System with electronic valves – direct drive to floor
Drive systems must be designed with a function for direct driving to floors without creep speed. The entire pump flow is delivered to the lifting cylinder at high speed up (without by-pass) to reduce energy use.
The Motor should be started with soft start. The valve system must be equipped with a self-adjusting and self-learning servo valve.
The maximum power output for the elevator must be XX A. (XX = depends on rated load and rated speed, ask Hydroware for information or calculate via Hydcalc).
Drive and control systems must be from the same manufacturer and must be system tested before delivery to ensure the shortest possible downtime, highest operational reliability and future support.
Both HydroElite VENI and VIDI
71.EA Control system in elevator installation
The control system must be able to be maintained and repaired by companies that the plant owner deems appropriate. All technical documentation, special tools, programming equipment, etc. required for service and maintenance must be included and remain usable for the life of the control system. Wiring diagrams must show all connections made in control cabinets. Documentation of all parameters and error codes must be included in operation and maintenance instructions. The supplier must undertake to deliver technical support, spare parts and more to any elevator company during the life of the control system. It must be possible to subsequently supplement or expand the control system with more functions.
All programmable and adjustable parameters and functions of the control system shall be possible to change the entire service life of the control system, without the need for any further reprogramming, accessories, lock codes or equipment to be procured by the system owner.
Control systems must be system tested together with the intended drive system.
HydroElite VIDI
71.EA
Frequently controlled motor system – reduced high speed at high load
Drive systems must be designed with a function that allows reduced high speed during construction and high loads. The rated speed at high speeds up must be reduced gradually when the load exceeds 25 percent of the rated load to reduce the power requirement.
The engine must be air-cooled and have an efficiency of at least 90%.
The maximum power output for the elevator must be XX A. (XX = depends on rated load and rated speed, ask Hydroware for information or calculate via Hydcalc).
Drive and control systems must be from the same manufacturer and must be system tested before delivery to ensure the shortest possible downtime, highest operational reliability and future support.
Remote Monitoring
Remote monitoring system with associated web-based user platform for compilation of all connected control systems from the product supplier. The network connection must be made via a private mobile network that must be encrypted. The following real-time information must be available via remote access:
HydroElite 3G-5.20 (V5)
Real-time information
Elevator operating status
Safety circuit status
Direction of travel
Error codes
Light curtain & photocells
Door status

Success story: From the perspective of an elevator consultant
To seek the best solution for each elevator project
“I was first tipped off about Hydroware by a contractor,” says Robin Primrose, an elevator consultant in Scotland. “It was a few years ago and now I have my own experience from a lot of installations.”
Impartial assessment
“For me as a consultant, it is important to make an impartial assessment for the customer in order to maintain credibility and so that the customer gets the best solution. That means I look at the total cost of installing and operating the elevator.”
Easy to install
“So far, I have only received positive comments from my clients about Hydroware’s system. They think it is easy to install, deliveries arrive on time and the system works immediately when you start it up. That my customer is satisfied with the product is absolutely crucial for me. ”
Advantage of modernizations
During the last years, 50% of the hydraulic systems I have proposed to the customer have come from Hydroware and that number will certainly increase in the future. Especially considering the advantage of carrying out renovations with Hydroware’s system without having to throw out the working parts of the old elevator.”

The HydroElite Experience
Passenger elevator
Passenger elevators are elevators that are intended for passenger transport. These elevators are common in, among other things, apartment buildings, tenant-owner associations, offices and public environments. Hydroware offers hydraulic passenger elevators for both
modernization and new installation
. A hydraulic elevator is preferable in apartment buildings up to
6-7 floors
and shopping centers up to 5 floors and 250,000 trips per year.
Replace passenger elevator
If there is a passenger elevator in a property that needs to be replaced, it should always be modernized. Modernizing the elevator  is
cheaper
,
faster
and is the most
sustainable option
. Many of the elevators components can be reused and can last as long as the property. Read more about
modernizing
elevators or
contact us and we will tell you more

VIDI
The top model from Hydroware
HydroElite VIDI
, which is the top model from Hydroware, is an integrated drive and control system for hydraulic elevators. It is equipped with Hydroware’s unique valve system which makes it possible for the elevator to go with direct to floor travel, completely without creeping. The valve also does not need to bypass the oil at full speed upwards. HydroElite VIDI is equipped with an efficient air-cooled IE2 motor and frequency control. The rated speed is gradually reduced when the load exceeds 25 percent of the rated load, which greatly reduces the power requirement.
HydroElite VIDI is available in both H2 and V5 models. H2 is the latest and most innovative lift control system, and it is designed for both the HydroElite H2 and TractionElite H2. With H2, you get one supplier for all your projects, simple installation and a future proof product thanks to our IoT capabilities.

Benefits with every HydroElite VIDI (H2 and V5)
Significantly reduced power demand and low energy consumption
HydroElite VIDI is equipped with a current-limiting drive and an air-cooled IE2 motor. Thanks to accepting that the speed is regulated down slightly from a load of 25%, you can reduce the power requirement up to 70%. According to VDI4707, only 20% of all trips are with more than 25% load. The air-cooled motor and the unique valve’s properties also reduce energy consumption by up to 70% compared to other conventional systems.
Quick installation
HydroElite VIDI is pre-assembled and function tested in our factory, which shortens the installation time. Commissioning is easily done with the help of a learning journey for the hydraulics and one for the floor plan setting. No manual adjustments are required and the valve accuracy increases for each trip.
Increased capacity and comfort
Direct approach to the floor and the fact that no bypass of the oil is needed gives shorter travel time and increased travel capacity. In addition, the reaction time from a command to start is very short due to the fact that the entire system is perfectly tuned, which also helps to increase the elevator’s capacity and comfort.
No overheated oil
Thanks to the valve’s unique properties, more trips can be made without the oil getting too hot. The air-cooled motor helps keep the oil cool. With a HydroElite VIDI, you normally do not have to worry about overheated oil and there is normally no need for an energy-intensive oil cooler.
Safer with one supplier
The fact that the drive and control system come from the same supplier provides increased security and easier handling in terms of support, service and guarantees throughout the lifespan of the elevator.

The HydroElite Experience - Hydroware
Close
The HydroElite Experience
The HydroElite Experience
The HydroElite Experience
is a concept that we at Hydroware have always worked from. We see ourselves not only as a product supplier, but also a partner who is with you throughout the lifespan of the elevator. With The HydroElite Experience, we offer multilingual support throughout the process and we have competent staff available at all levels for you as a customer.
If you ask us at Hydroware, you do not only buy a product – you also buy a long-term sustainable elevator solution that improves the quality of life and makes everyday life a little easier.
Customer needs
Sometimes it can be difficult to know how to proceed and what is the best solution. Older elevators that need to be upgraded do not have to mean high investment costs, long downtime and in the long run expensive service agreements. Whether it is modernization or new elevators, we are here to help you find the best solution.
Measurement
We have developed data and
help tools
that make it easier for you as a customer to make measurements in a simple and efficient way. As a partner, we are with you and answer any questions that arise along the way. Our goal is that together we get the right conditions for a well-executed project.
Offer
With the help of our tools and templates, you can yourself, or together with us, easily communicate the elevator’s specific data needed to obtain a quote for the project. Thanks to our long experience in hydraulic elevators and our efficient processes, we can prepare a complete quote
within 24 hours
.
Order
Thanks to the fact that we have developed a complete product for modernization with drive and control systems, we can provide short lead times. Normally we produce a HydroElite within 4 weeks, but we can also deliver by express within 1-2 weeks. For us, it is important to be able to be flexible, and we can therefore handle minor changes to the order without it having to affect delivery times.
Installation
Another advantage of our combined
HydroElite
drive and control system is that it significantly reduces installation times. All our products are pre-wired and factory tested before delivery.
This in combination with the efficient commissioning and our indicative support means the shortest installation and downtime available in the industry.
Generous support package
In our generous support package, we offer multilingual technical support for both drive and control systems with the option of on-site support assistance when needed. If spare parts are needed, they will be with you
within 24 hours
. In order for you to get to know our products better, we can also offer training in preparation, installation, troubleshooting and service.
For us, nothing is impossible, and we stand for it. We have a long experience of solving projects that others normally say no to. We never give up until you are completely satisfied.
Success story
Hydroware’s system is well thought out
“For me as a elevator fitter, it is easy to work with Hydroware’s system. Everything comes packed and ready for assembly. Just tear out the old parts to be replaced and install the new ones. There will be short assembly times.”
2Hydroware’s system is well thought out and easy to install and start up. Competing systems require a great deal of experience to get started. ”
“Another important thing for us fitters is the support. We can only say that it is very good and with no competition. We needed to replace a part during an assembly in Kristianstad and then someone took the car directly from Hydroware and drove the part down to us. In just over an hour, the problem was solved. “
“There is a reason why Hydroware has grown and that is that they have the best hydraulic system on the market.”
Bosse Wallman and Ingolf Svensson, elevator fitters, give their views on the installation of the drive and control system from Hydroware.
